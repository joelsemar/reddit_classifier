The surprise of a sincere compliment with no alternative motivation is where the effect on these cards comes from. The only reason I do it is to make a girl smile. I like giving them to cashiers, of leaving them with the bill at a restaurant. I avoid giving them out at a bar because they are most likely to be turned down or thrown on the floor there. Sometimes I will get a hug, sometimes I will have a short chat with the recipient, but most often they will do a very typical response by putting their hand on their mouth or chest, give you the biggest stupid smile ever and just look at it for a few seconds. You can give them to the same gender too but that requires a little bit of care and analysis of the persons personality as there is the very real chance it can backfire. \n\n\nPrint some for yourself and try it. You will be surprised at how well received they are and just the feeling you get when you make somebody's day is all the motivation I need. If you do give one out be confident. They are not going to turn it down, they are not going to be creeped out as long as you are sincere.

Now there are many, many, many people who have and are breaking out of this cultural paradigm, but the sheer fact that this was posted on reddit today proves that so much of these gender stereotypes still exist. \n\nAs a fairly average bisexual woman, i'm pretty open to a lot of sexual things. I certainly like it rough every now and then, but when i watch porn I just cringe. Even during some supposedly female focused scenes, I just can't imagine myself or any of the women i've been with enjoying what is displayed in a lot of porn. Most women can't orgasm from penetration alone, and yet so much (not all) of porn displays screaming orgasms from baseball bat sized penises.\n\nAnyhow, I think our culture is really coming around to being more sexually open.

We are all primates. But unfortunately, some people (i.e., the people who make this sort of joke) see black people as more closely related to monkeys, and they take that notion way too far.\n\nNow, I don't give a flying fuck about that sort of thing. If black people did evolve first, and are **slightly** more closely related to monkeys than white people, then to me that would be a scientific fact that is completely irrelevant to the more modern human lifestyle.\n\nBut then there's this thing called social darwinism. People went and took evolution and applied it to the human race. It was used as an argument for supporting natural selection (even eugenics) in our species (oh, they can't provide for themselves in this complicated economy? obviously they don't have genes worth passing on) as well as slavery. One of the many pro-slavery arguments used was that black people were inferior and obviously wouldn't be able to care for themselves without the white man's help. Social darwinism is also closely linked to Nazi ideology.\n\nSo, that's why this particular joke is especially wrong.\n\nBut, come on, of course it's racist. Just like jokes about black people and watermelons, or fried chicken. The poster is making a stereotype about a skin color.

You read that right. Instant. Fucking. Jello. That stuff where you boil water, put the powder in, and put cold water in and fridger-ize it. That thing.\n\nI was like 8 or 9 at the time. It was after school one day and parents were out for some reason. And for no reason, I really REALLY wanted jello. I, for whatever reason, did not want to wait the two hours before parents came home + fridge time to eat it. I wanted it now, and by God I was going to eat some.\n\nI wanted this batch of jello to be really awesome and different. So, instead of boiling just regular water, I went for sprite/7-up. I got like 5 cans and measured out the required two cups. I got a pan from under the stove and put the soda in and turned the stove on high. So far so good. \n\nI got out the big bowl to put the boiling soda and powder in. By some miracle, I managed not to fuck up the boiling soda/pot combo by burning myself or anyone. I got the boiling soda and powder mixed. I wanted to eat it as soon as possible, and I did not want my parents to see my mess/evidence of me cooking (I was too young). I knew that it would have to cool down and solidify quickly if I were to pull it off. In science, I was taught that Water+ice+salt gets really cold. (Yes....) So, I put in the two cups of cold water, quite a few pieces of ice, and salt. And about the salt. \\*Sigh\\* Being the immature 9 year old-ish that I was, a couple of days before, thought it would be funny to do the old loose salt shaker lid prank. I forgot about it. Have you ever tried to frantically pull out un-dissolved salt, out of a really hot solution of soda and jello mix? It. Sucks.\n\nSo, after getting out about 5% of the soaking salt, I decided that it was time, not to throw it out like I should have done, but, to put it into the freezer. Because if a fridge (cold) gets it hard in ~4 hours, then a freezer (colder) should get it done a lot quicker than that. I left the ice in, thinking that I'll take them out later, or they'll dissolve or something (neither ended up happening). I went and watched Spongebob or something, and completely forgot about it in the freezer.\n\nWhen my parents ended up coming home from wherever they were, many hours later, I jolted. Suddenly remembering that I had jello in the freezer. (The sound of the garage door reminded me or something). I sprinted over to the freezer and took out a frozen solid block of jello, complete with floating icebergs of ice, permanently frozen in the sea of jello.\n\nI scooped out the ice with a spoon (it wasn't easy). But that left it with big craters in the surface, and as everybody knows, jello is smooth. Mine is rock solid and had gigantic holes in it. I knew that a way to 'fill in' the holes is to melt it. What machine melts stuff?... Well, the microwave of course!.. Yes. I put a frozen, holey, salty, soda-jello in the microwave. It was in there about 4 minutes before my dad came in from outside (getting the mail or something). \n\nMy dad came in *just* as the microwave was beeping done. He wondered what was in the microwave. I honestly said \"jello\". The look on his face was priceless. It was a concoction of wonder, worry, surprised, and lastly, fear. He decided to accept it and proceeded to open up the microwave. No amount of preparedness, nor acceptance could have forewarned what ghastly stench came out of the cursed microwave. It was a mainly burnt strawberry (because, you know, jello, much less *frozen* jello, burns quite readily), with a predominant sweet scent with subtle traces of the massive salt content. (If it sounds like I know this smell too much, it's because I do. I had to spend two hours with a brush and hot, soapy water with my head inside the hellish nightmare that was the microwave, trying to clean it) It was the stench that was only rivaled by my childish attempt to impress a girl by drinking/eating picklejuice+peanutbutter (If any kids are thinking about doing this. Don't).\n\nIf the look on my dad's face was priceless before, the look on his face now, broke that scale. Upon seeing the boiling mass that was (key word: \"was\") the jello, he became speechless. It could best be described in three words: What. The. Fuck. After he became immune to the smell (or more likely, his nose hairs burned off) and regained his composure, he wanted to know the story behind this. I told him.\n\nAs punishment, I had to try to wash out the scent that was ingrained in the microwave. It took me about two hours to do, mostly because I was 9 and bitched through every second of it, and dragged my feet wherever possible.\n\nAnd if you are wondering how it tasted. Don't. Just. Just don't.\n\n**TL;DR** Good intentions will get you two things: hell, and a fucked up jello and microwave combination. Still not sure which one is worse.\n\nedit: Wow.

He tells me I just need to put some oil in a pan along with some bread and cheese. Simple enough.\n\nSo I go upstairs and put some vegetable oil in a pan and start heating it up. I then put some cheese between two slices of bread and wait until the oil starts to pop.

Run back to the kitchen to find my concoction fully ablaze. I go to throw some water on it and he's yelling at me not to do that. He simply grabbed a plate, put it over the pan, and effectively snuffed the fire out. I think the smell was in the house for a good six or seven hours.\n\nThankfully, I've since improved since those days. Incidentally, it was the same method that I used to invent fried french toast.

He's passed out on the bed. I yell at him to wake the fuck up and to clean up else the motel will probably fine us. Queue to him rubbing the inside of the microwave with wet paper towel and spraying half a bottle of febreeze in the air.  As this is going on I go back to bed and fall asleep, but not for long.\n\n\nWake up to the room filled to the brim with smoke, I'm coughing badly and basically the microwave melting.  My roommate had tried for round two on the popcorn and had again, put it in for a ridiculous amount of time and passed out, only I wasn't awake to save the microwave this time.\n As I opened it up there was a charred black partially burning bag of popcorn in there... probably only a minute away from setting fire to the wall or something.\n\nNow imagine the stench of burnt popcorn, melted plastic and some shitty lavendar febreeze all mixed into one.  The motel did fine us for smoke damage and destroying their microwave.  Told my boss the story and he made my roommate pay for everything and buddy go fired. Only bad thing? the motel where we were staying was filled up, so I had to stay a week in a room that smelt god fucking awful.

Then for the head you make it 3d when you add in the equator circle that the eyes will be on, and the hemisphere circle that the nose will be on.. The circles at that point work as a substructure and make a big difference in pose quality and sketch speed, if you are just drawing surface details without this step the picture will often be poorly framed in the space or can contain a disjointed area which wanders off from the rest and breaks the reality of the image.

So you have to erase.  *The whole leg!*\n\nNow if you construct with basic shapes first, you end up very quickly with a creature.  A creature without any definition but a creature nonetheless.  You can then take a step back, flip the paper around, check out where you are so far and judge whether to proceed ahead or correct something.  If your leg is too skinny, then you need to only erase the few circles and sticks you used to construct the leg's basic shape, instead of undoing several minutes of shading and detailing.", "downs": 0, "id": "c8ab47s", "ups": 1}, {"body": "fuckin true.", "downs": 1, "id": "c8aa2o4", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Believe it or not, when you get to a better understanding of drawing, this is how you will break down what you want to draw.

Mixed drinks have numerous characteristics and if you look carefully, it's organized roughly by type, ingredients, glass, and method of preparation -- essentially, it's a a number of nested arrays. There are a number of drinks in the second half with little relation to each other, but you can observe a number of patterns within the diagram:  \n-across the same drink type, it groups the ingredients together (e.g., whiskey series at top, manhattan/martini/gibson, daiquiri/stinger, gin fizz-gimlet-vodka gimlet transition, layered drinks in lower right)  \n-within this rough grouping, the order is refined via preparation methods: first plain, then shaken w/ ice and removed, then stirred, float/layer on top of ingredient, and then stir assembly w/ cracked ice. This is also the same pattern used in the key from left to right.  \n-there is an observable progression in glasses (rocks, tall rocks, highball, cocktail, chalice) although it appears method of preparation is a more important variable and changes will reset the glass pattern.\n\nThere's also a generally defined demographic pattern. The majority of the first two rows are ordered by both genders or more often by males while the common feminine drinks start with the daiquiri. These go straight through to summer drinks and then the cheap unisex drinks on the two bottom rows, with more froo-froo to the right.\n\nIt looks like a bit of a mess because there are a number of unrelated but common mixed drinks expected by consumers and the details of their construction are largely unfamiliar to much of the public. I found there to be an admirable consistency in presentation and have had little trouble perusing this.

There are a number of drinks in the second half with little relation to each other, but you can observe a number of patterns within the diagram:  \n-across the same drink type, it groups the ingredients together (e.g., whiskey series at top, manhattan/martini/gibson, daiquiri/stinger, gin fizz-gimlet-vodka gimlet transition, layered drinks in lower right)  \n-within this rough grouping, the order is refined via preparation methods: first plain, then shaken w/ ice and removed, then stirred, float/layer on top of ingredient, and then stir assembly w/ cracked ice. This is also the same pattern used in the key from left to right.  \n-there is an observable progression in glasses (rocks, tall rocks, highball, cocktail, chalice) although it appears method of preparation is a more important variable and changes will reset the glass pattern.\n\nThere's also a generally defined demographic pattern. The majority of the first two rows are ordered by both genders or more often by males while the common feminine drinks start with the daiquiri. These go straight through to summer drinks and then the cheap unisex drinks on the two bottom rows, with more froo-froo to the right.\n\nIt looks like a bit of a mess because there are a number of unrelated but common mixed drinks expected by consumers and the details of their construction are largely unfamiliar to much of the public. I found there to be an admirable consistency in presentation and have had little trouble perusing this. The extra information on preparation is a nice addition to the obvious use as a reference for ingredients.\n\n**tl;dr - This is actually a very organized reference with a lot of utility.**", "downs": 6, "id": "c8a9le4", "ups": 30}, {"body": "No, the key legend is perfectly fine.

You can pick up one right now for $100. I spent 200 and got one that was Russian, serially matching and in extremely nice condition. The cheaper ones are usually chinese or one of the dozen other countries that produced them for awhile. A lot of fun to shoot and surplus ammo is very cheap, but requires a lot more maintenance since it is corrosive. Non-corrosive is a bit more expensive. Also not easy to add a scope. On a 93, the sniper variant, it'll be more expensive but you can acquire them already scoped, otherwise you need a gunsmith to drill the receiver for a custom job. It stems from the way the straight handled bolt cycles, requiring the scope to be mounted to the side more than the top of the gun. I went with the carbine version and was happy shooting iron sights though I did look into what was available scope-wise. Best thing I could conclude was that most people went the scout scope option which involved pulling the rear iron sight and putting in a rail and scope in that position. It's called a scout scope set up because the scope is several inches forward, about 4-6, so you need a long relief scope and generally you use this with both eyes open, the scout aspect being that you can continue to observe things out of your off eye while scoping with the other. I ended up not doing this to the gun because I wasn't interested in the scout scope set up. The only other option I ever saw was to put on a custom rail in the rear sight area with a supported rail that extended back over the bolt area to hold a scope in that position which would be more in line with what most other scoped rifles look like. To do that you also needed a gunsmith to turn down the handle of your bolt in the curved style most other rifles adhere to. This option seemed more practical for someone shooting the 93 version with the intent of long distance shooting. For the money, I didn't want to do it to my carbine version, not to mention I enjoyed the iron sights plenty enough.", "downs": 0, "id": "c8ab38k", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Yes, the svt-40 had a detachable mag, and it snaps in quite nicely, too, very modern and probably easier to load than an AK.

The windows were designed and executed by Napier Waller, a Victorian artist who lost his right arm during that war. The walls and dome of the Hall are lined with one of the largest mosaics in the world, also the work of Waller and unveiled in 1959. The mosaic inside the dome depicts the souls of the dead rising from the earth towards their spiritual home, represented by a glowing sun within the Southern Cross. The figures on the walls \u2013 a soldier, a sailor, an airman and a servicewoman \u2013 recall the Australian experience of the Second World War. Over six million pieces of glass tesserae were used in the composition; it was installed by an Italian craftsman and took over three years to complete.\n\nBehind the arches leading to the tomb are the [memorial walls](http://canberra.com.au/static/campfire/canberra.com.au/images/content-images/canberra_australian_war_memorial-300.jpg), with the names of deceased servicemen and women from all military Australian conflicts - there are little channels next to the rows of names where people can place a paper poppy next to the name of a relative or friend as a mark of honour.\n\nThere's also an excellent museum attached to the memorial, and the National Archives, where you can search the service records of deceased personel, as well as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, who can assist in locating the resting places or memorials of Commonwealth war dead.", "downs": 1, "id": "c8a2wkm", "ups": 9}, {"body": "Yes.

As for why the tomb must be so protected, in the early 1920's, we didn't have guards and the Tomb looked much different. People often came to the cemetery in those days for picnics during which time some would actually use the Tomb as a picnic area (probably because of the view). Soon after, 1925, they posted a civilian guard; in 1926, a military guard was posted during cemetery hours; and on July 1, 1937, this was expanded to the 24-hour watch. Since then, the ceremony has developed throughout the years to what we have today. Today, most of the challenges faced by the Sentinels are tourists who want to get a better picture or uncontrolled children (which generally is very frightening for the parent when the Soldier challenges the child).\n\nThe Guard is changed every thirty minutes during the summer (April 1 to Sep 30) and every hour during the winter (Oct 1 to Mar 31). During the hours the cemetery is closed, the guard is changed every 2 hours. The Tomb is guarded, and has been guarded, every minute of every day since 1937.

The sun similarly causes tides, of which the theoretical amplitude is about 25 centimetres (9.8 in) (46% of that of the moon) with a cycle time of 12 hours. At spring tide the two effects add to each other to a theoretical level of 79 centimetres (31 in), while at neap tide the theoretical level is reduced to 29 centimetres (11 in). Since the orbits of the Earth about the sun, and the moon about the Earth, are elliptical, tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying Earth\u2013sun and Earth\u2013moon distances. This causes a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about \u00b118% for the moon and \u00b15% for the sun. If both the sun and moon were at their closest positions and aligned at new moon, the theoretical amplitude would reach 93 centimetres (37 in).\n\n[image](http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/spring-neap.jpg)", "downs": 1, "id": "c8a06bl", "ups": 16}, {"body": "This hardly explains why where I used to live in England, a spring tide would be 35 feet and a neap tide 14 feet.", "downs": 0, "id": "c8a0fwl", "ups": 4}, {"body": "Tide goes in, tide goes out...", "downs": 0, "id": "c8a14s1", "ups": 6}, {"body": "you cant explain that! or actually they just did but im too lazy to read", "downs": 1, "id": "c8a2gpa", "ups": 2}, {"body": "Tide reports are free.

I don't like to leave too much since it absorbs a lot of vinegar and ends up being too tart but again that's preference.\n\nAfter you end up with a pile of rinds, you need to salt them a little to draw out some of the moisture so brine with about 1/2 cup of salt overnight.\n\n\n\nAfter typing all this I did a quick search and this is formatted and has quantities.  The below recipe is a southern style.  For mine I omit cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and lemon. Instead I use chili powder about 1-2 tablespoons for a gallon jar, a few fresh thai peppers, and 3 cloves of garlic.  Otherwise it's the same process.  Experiment!\n\nI don't like boiling mine too long in the simple syrup because I like a little snap when I eat them as opposed to them being chewy.  If it's too tart, add more water and sugar.  I made a batch once and totally spaced and forgot the water and added pure vinegar.  I salvaged it by soaking in water overnight to draw out some of the vinegar so it's hard to ruin a batch.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n\n* 2 quarts watermelon rind (equal to one medium-sized melon)\n* 3/4 cup salt\n* 3 quarts water\n* 5 cups sugar\n* 3 cups white vinegar\n* 3 cups water\n* 1 tablespoon (about 48) whole cloves\n* 6 cinnamon sticks, broken into 1-inch pieces\n* 1 tablespoon Allspice\n* 1 lemon, thinly sliced, with seeds removed\n\nTrim the pink flesh and the green outer skin from the rind. Cut into small strips, about 1\" x 2\". Cover with brine made by combining 3 quarts water and 3/4 cup salt. Refrigerate for five hours or overnight.\n\nDrain; rinse. Cover the watermelon with water and bring to a boil; continue cooking until fork-tender, about another 15 minutes. (Overcooking will cause the rinds to become rubbery.)

I am going to retire.\" He announced it the day the playoffs started, which was still a few games from the Super Bowl so you are technically correct but your wording made it sound like he didn't retire until he realized he was extremely close to the Super Bowl.

In this case, the residence hall that the writer lived in was along the \"Far Quad\". The writer also incorporated other hints of Notre Dame in the movie \"Shrek\". For example, the castle is a replica of the Notre Dame Library. Also, Notre Dame's full name is The University of Notre Dame du Lac (The University of Our Lady of the Lake)--which is where Duloc got its name.\n\nFrom [here.](http://everything.explained.at/Lord_Farquaad/)", "downs": 4, "id": "c8a0f69", "ups": 12}, {"body": "Yeah, that sounds like a contrived bullshit story to cover their asses when some up-tight parents caught onto the joke.\n\nKind of like how the \"Grumpy Cat's\" name, Tard, is short for Tardar Sauce.

So Notre Dame cathedral is actually \"Notre Dame de Paris\".  There's an important and old Catholic cemetery in Montreal called \"Notre Dame des Neiges\", meaning Our Lady of the Snows.\n\nSo, presumably, there is some lake nearby and the university was named \"Notre Dame du Lac\" because of that.\n\nCatholics love naming stuff after the Virgin Mary.  If you're touring Europe and want to know if a cathedral is Protestant or Catholic, nine times out of ten it is Protestant if it has a short name like \"Hamburg Cathedral\" or \"St. Paul's Cathedral\" and it is Catholic if it has a long-ass name involving Mary, like \"Cathedral of Mary, Mother of God, Queen of the Universe\".", "downs": 0, "id": "c8a88zd", "ups": 1}, {"body": "Sounds plausible, but....\n\n&gt;In Duloc, you'll find Lord Farquaad's castle, which some think looks a lot like Notre Dame's Hesburgh Library.

At no time was any of the banter malicious or ignorant to SK's capabilities and did not refer to it as being anything but innocuous or good for the South Koreans.\n\nIn short, the actual segment was a normal conversation about a South Korean achievement of a satellite launch\n\n\nSo while you guys continue to love Colbert, know this.. it is no longer just a comedy show about stupid republicans based in truth.\n\nit is now bias and media spin.\n\nBut I am speaking to deaf ears here.

Don't have to read it...it was more catharsis for me to write than anything. \n\nNah, China plays by the rules. It's just their rules they follow. What I mean is, a huge pillar of Chinese foreign policy is that of respecting state sovereignty. They bemoan any intrusion into their domestic affairs (e.g., selling element X to country Y is our business. Respect our sovereignty), and also deplore intrusions into other states' domestic affairs as well (e.g., world policing). Basically, they believe a country's affairs are its own, and it's none of our business to intervene unless absolutely necessary. \n\nSo, the caveat to this is, \"Well what about Tibet? What about Taiwan?\" and you're absolutely right, but like I said. The reason China does not see itself as being hypocritical in that regard is because they already see these places as being part of China, and in some ways, they have a point [E.g., The story of Taiwan is akin to the US Government retreating to Maine during the Civil War, claiming Maine is now the seat of political power instead of Washington D.C., and then spending the next several decades awkwardly having foreign relations with other countries as the \"US Government\" before people start to realize, \"You know what, the other 49 states are kind of the US Government whether we like it or not. Maybe we should start formally recognizing them.\" Taiwan has never really been a separate country with a legacy of its own so much as it has always been a part of China. It's formal title is The Republic of China, a holdover from when the Chinese government fled there during the revolution.]\n\nWhat I mean is, if you look at things from the perspective of China, they believe that they really *are* steadfast about respecting sovereignty. And they interact with North Korea not because they *like* North Korea so much as they hold strongly to the core idea of \"what countries do is their business\".  The perception that they are two countries, China being the lesser of two evils, colluding in the East, is a misconception. For this reason, I don't worry when people voice fears of some sort of 'inevitable WWIII with a rising China' or other ridiculous notions. China really do operate by core principles, and in many regards, they are incredibly persistent in these principles. They state, explicitly, that they do not seek to expand, do not seek aggression, and will not resort to force or the threat of force to resolve international disputes. This logic holds true for China, even through the Korean war. That is not to say China is right, ethical or morally sound in their foreign policy. I'm only trying to explain things as they see it.\n\nThey're not interested in war mongering or imperialism and haven't been since the Deng Xiaping era. You know in the later seasons of The Wire, when Stringer starts taking business classes and realizes that gang-banging is just one of many games, and he can make it just as big playing the suit and tie game in the real world? That is sort of China since the 1980s. China's concern for its economy and development dwarfs any other concern of theirs by a large margin.", "downs": 9, "id": "c89zlcn", "ups": 23}]

Don't have to read it...it was more catharsis for me to write than anything. \n\nNah, China plays by the rules. It's just their rules they follow. What I mean is, a huge pillar of Chinese foreign policy is that of respecting state sovereignty. They bemoan any intrusion into their domestic affairs (e.g., selling element X to country Y is our business. Respect our sovereignty), and also deplore intrusions into other states' domestic affairs as well (e.g., world policing). Basically, they believe a country's affairs are its own, and it's none of our business to intervene unless absolutely necessary. \n\nSo, the caveat to this is, \"Well what about Tibet? What about Taiwan?\" and you're absolutely right, but like I said. The reason China does not see itself as being hypocritical in that regard is because they already see these places as being part of China, and in some ways, they have a point [E.g., The story of Taiwan is akin to the US Government retreating to Maine during the Civil War, claiming Maine is now the seat of political power instead of Washington D.C., and then spending the next several decades awkwardly having foreign relations with other countries as the \"US Government\" before people start to realize, \"You know what, the other 49 states are kind of the US Government whether we like it or not. Maybe we should start formally recognizing them.\" Taiwan has never really been a separate country with a legacy of its own so much as it has always been a part of China. It's formal title is The Republic of China, a holdover from when the Chinese government fled there during the revolution.]\n\nWhat I mean is, if you look at things from the perspective of China, they believe that they really *are* steadfast about respecting sovereignty. And they interact with North Korea not because they *like* North Korea so much as they hold strongly to the core idea of \"what countries do is their business\".  The perception that they are two countries, China being the lesser of two evils, colluding in the East, is a misconception. For this reason, I don't worry when people voice fears of some sort of 'inevitable WWIII with a rising China' or other ridiculous notions. China really do operate by core principles, and in many regards, they are incredibly persistent in these principles. They state, explicitly, that they do not seek to expand, do not seek aggression, and will not resort to force or the threat of force to resolve international disputes. This logic holds true for China, even through the Korean war. That is not to say China is right, ethical or morally sound in their foreign policy. I'm only trying to explain things as they see it.\n\nThey're not interested in war mongering or imperialism and haven't been since the Deng Xiaping era. You know in the later seasons of The Wire, when Stringer starts taking business classes and realizes that gang-banging is just one of many games, and he can make it just as big playing the suit and tie game in the real world? That is sort of China since the 1980s. China's concern for its economy and development dwarfs any other concern of theirs by a large margin.", "downs": 9, "id": "c89zlcn", "ups": 23}]

The entire place is run down as fuck, circus was fired, movie theater is falling apart, and the outdoor thrift market \"swap shop\" literally looked like a third world country. The weirdest part of the place is that the owner is an ex-race car driver scumbag, so when you go to the indoor section, there is a multi-million dollar supercar museum butt up against cheap mexican cell phone accessories. He has a Bugatti Veyron, Ferrari Enzo and FXX, the Ferrari from 80's Miami Vice in the middle of the circus ring, just to name a few, it's incredible and surreal at the same time.\n\n**tl;dr:** The Ft. Lauderdale Swap Shop is a disgusting rundown flea market that looks like a 3rd world country, and it contains the biggest exotic car collection I've ever seen in an old circus ring.", "downs": 1, "id": "c89z479", "ups": 4}, {"body": "I never understood the term \"unsweetened\".

If so, why don't you eat mentally disabled people xanthus? Or babies for that matter?

However, the difference is that pigs are nowhere near as far up the evolutionary ladder as humans. They are not capable of conceptual thought as humans are. Even the mentally handicapped are capable of conceptualizing on some level. The jump from being an omnivore to being a cannibal is difficult to swallow. While I see your line of logic, I don't agree.  I admit that the consuming of flesh is a selfish thing, I do not deny that, but I do not consider it an evil. It is reprehensible, but it is not the heinous act many paint it as. As per your analogy regarding race, I fell it holds little weight. A human feeling superior to a pig is not equal to a human feeling superior to another human. The superiority that many Caucasians allowed themselves to feel is and was born of ignorance and falsehood. Difference in culture and difference in species is not the same thing. There is little if any difference between the brain and mental processes of a white man versus a black man, but there is a vast difference in the physical structure and internal processes between that of a human being and that of even our closest animal relatives, and you don't see people eating apes. At least I've never heard of it.

He improved relations with China and Russia during a time when that just didn't seem doable, he signed into law the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Vietnam war ended on his watch (although how much credit he deserves for each of these is certainly debatable), and he even tried to implement health reforms that are in some ways similar to what Obama finally accomplished with the ACA (though Nixon also advocated for HMOs, despite that he acknowledged it resulting in less care given to patients so that private entities could profit).\n\nSome on the right seek to highlight Nixon's admittedly notable accomplishments and minimize his failings, but thanks to popular entertainment like Futurama, that just isn't happening. Everyone remembers Nixon as the guy who doth protest too much when growling \"I am not a crook!\" (which incidentally had nothing to do with Watergate), the guy quick to anger, who kept a list of enemies, and who cheated the system even when he didn't need to.\n\nIt's not entirely fair... but it shouldn't be. The presidency is the highest office in the land, a symbol meant to be a guiding beacon for our populace. Theoretically, it is a position to be reserved for our best, our brightest, our most honest and pure (though of course we all know that human nature makes such an expectation unrealistically optimistic). And when the president does something less than admirable, he shames us as a nation, and that shame should taint his name throughout history.\n\nThis is why, despite Nixon's accomplishments, it is fitting that he will likely be forever remembered as a mean-spirited, scheming crook. Just as Clinton will undoubtedly be remembered for his infidelity and Bush Jr. will surely be remembered for his stupidity. And while Obama's opponents desperately try to pin him as one cartoon character or another, none of these seem to be sticking, likely because despite that he's only human and certainly isn't without his failings, he has generally maintained the integrity of the position he represents.\n\ntl;dr - Nixon may have been a good president, and accomplished some great things... but fuck him.

That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?", "downs": 6, "id": "c8a03if", "ups": 2}, {"body": "I think you are a dick?", "downs": 0, "id": "c89z6ca", "ups": 5}, {"body": "It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far.
