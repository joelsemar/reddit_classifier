c8d0604	14	1	she looks.... different.
c8d0fcm	20	1	It's a weird shot because she's laughing.  I fucking *love* the way she looks though.  Huge crush on her from arrested development. 
c8d0n2m	6	0	My Portia de Rossi crush dates from her appearances on Ally Mc Beal!
c8d0n66	8	2	She got a lot of work done since the original run of Arrested Development. She looks a little weird now. Attached is a pic, but bum yourself out and do a search. These are how she looks now.  http://www.justjared.com/photo-gallery/2727341/ellen-degeneres-emmys-2012-portia-de-rossi-02/  As an aside, I've actually always found Ellen to be very beautiful. I'm a straight dude and I've never found Ellen "hot," but I think she was a killer choice for Cover Girl. Ellen has a very fresh, pure, beautiful look that is also natural. I wish Portia had taken her style cues from Ellen.
c8d0oic	7	0	she's also aged... it's been like 8-10 years since arrested development aired

c8d0pg4	2	1	I wish it was socially acceptable for me to do that too...
c8d08kf	57	27	I'd take Portia De Rossi over Katy Perry any day of the week.  Even with the boobs.
c8d0gsk	24	8	Portia just has something about her that I can't explain.  Katy looks generic to me at this point, she looks great for sure, but Portia just does it for me.  I have a thing for lesbians I guess, happens all the time in real life too.  
c8d0j6j	11	8	Agreed.  Plus, Portia is, like 40 years old, and she looks damn good!  I'm skeptical about how Katy's gonna look in 15-ish years....
c8d0jnz	4	0	If you're Ellen, you don't need to choose between Portia and ogling Katy. If you're anyone else, good luck doing either
c8czu5t	10	2	I just realized that having a lesbian friend would be awesome because we can talk about how hot that chick over there is and it wouldn't be weird.
c8d031a	11	2	Speaking generally, I find women attractive in VERY different ways than my male friends.  "Her ass is divine! I want to rub my face on it!" "She's wearing jeggings?! Who does that!"

c8d0ot8	1	1	Well, if I got to Meet Katy Perry, I'd react the same way.  Except with a raging boner.  
c8d0oz9	3	0	If you sneak a peek of someones boobs and get caught, you are a pervy buffoon.   If you blatantly stare with your jaw hanging down and play it off as a joke, you get a much nicer and longer look while everyone giggles and allows it.   Wat
c8d0p6a	2	1	Even Ellen DeGeneres gets the PSY Screamies occasionally. 
c8d0qym	1	1	hell yeah
c8d0dla	8	3	A friend of mine works for a high-wire/rigging company in Vegas and has spent months at a time on tour with Katy, doing the wire work for her shows.  His summary:  "1. Raging c-u-next-tuesday.  2.  Awesome boobs.  The boobs are great enough to make her tolerable."

c8d0o83	1	0	You and me both Ellen
c8d0oee	1	1	I know I'm going to get downvoted but I think Katy Perry is a butterface. She doesn't look bad in this picture, but ever since I saw her in the HIMYM episode, I can't look at her and not think that she resembles an alien. 
c8d0p3q	1	1	Best tits in the biz.
c8d0pmk	1	1	Shit, this got to the front page fast.
c8d0qe5	1	1	They are spectacular!

c8cvx5l	1016	155	Haha I don't think I was that drunk maybe 2 or 3 beers in.  Light lagers.  I was sipping on an oatmeal porter at the time.
c8cwqnx	1147	172	This is crazy, I was just scrolling down on RES and seeing your picture gave me a shock. It's been probably like 6 or 7 years since I saw you, but do you remember Adnan (Bengali kid) from freshman year at UT? Always hung around Melrose with Iman, Shiraz, Izzy, Sergio, and everyone else playing Halo and shit? We used to ball together too.  
c8cy7bm	295	25	Adnan!  You referred yourself in 3rd person and faked me out!  I remember you very well we had some good times!  You said I had chicken legs and couldn't box anyone out in the paint!!!!!  I never forgot that and since then I've made sure to get some extra squats in at the gym because of you hahahaaa!!!  
c8cysaq	99	6	Oh man, now I feel bad (if I made you feel inadequate or something). I think I said that more trying to point out how you could improve your game to become awesome since you already had height, speed, and a decent shot. At least I helped in some way!  Don't worry, I got my comeuppance. I'm outrageously slow and out of shape now, and can only last like two or three full court games before I feel like my heart will give out. I'm gonna add you on facebook so I'll hit you up there (unless redditors enjoy this interaction, which they seem to be doing).
c8cywpp	89	7	Glad you hit me up man every time I think about old college days I think of our bouts at the TRECS and hanging out around the dorms.  We had some awesome times.

c8cx6kz	81	6	Aww come on, you could be part of the gang. He'd introduce you like, "This is Iman, Shiraz, Izzy, Sergio, and John... he's our token white guy".

c8d0jan	3	0	My ex-husband took our snowblower and created a sledding hill for our daughter.  Just kept going in circles, round and round, and ended up with a decent sized hill!  She loved it! Of course, we had a giant pile of snow in our backyard until mid-June, but it was well-worth it!!

c8czqtm	7	1	Can someone explain to him how to make said gif
c8d0jzi	1	0	Impossible to loop perfectly 
c8d0etj	2	0	He doesn't do this because, in reality, he simply made this trench then set his dogs in it while they looked at him with a confused look. 
c8cy2l7	86	11	See, though, I could never do this with my husky. She would ignore the path and dive head-first into the wall of snow.
c8cyyc9	16	0	Amen to that I have a German short hair and he makes tunnels in snow mounds. 
c8cz8nl	5	0	Yep that's my lab, as well.
c8d08y4	8	1	Yes, dog.
c8d0tal	1	0	I thought the same about my lab, but he's really not liking the 20" of powder. Probably because his legs aren't 20" long.

c8cxp9n	49	6	You cut up the lawn. Dad is going to be pissed.

c8czpzj	7	1	"Hey. This poop looks familiar. You sure we ain't runnin' 'round in circles?"
c8cymsg	47	7	You're ruining the grass. You should've left a little bit of snow on top of it. Advice from a Canadian.
c8cz9lw	19	1	How is it ruining the grass? Question from an Australian.
c8czd8z	17	0	The soil, when exposed like that, is easily damaged by foot traffic when the snow and ground thaws. Leaving a thin layer gives the grass and soil a little padding and insulation. 
c8czkpj	7	2	Not to mention the removing of grass with a shovel / snow blower.  Shoveling snow on grass is just asking for terrible grass in the summer ;)  
c8cztdv	3	1	Also, digging that far into the snow requires quite a bit of strength. You're probably partially digging up the lawn if you do it that close with a shovel.
c8czaxq	6	0	Its cutting right into it.
c8d02yd	5	0	In the northern hemisphere, the grass grows up and out of the ground. When you damage the surface with something like the bottom edge of a snowblower, it will remain damaged until it has time to fix itself or be treated in the spring.
c8d07rc	1	0	I like the subtle upside down joke you threw in there.
c8czl61	25	11	People in the US care way too much about grass
c8cztud	11	13	DAE HATE THE US?
c8czw1m	12	3	Yes. Saying people in the US tend to care too much about lawn care is totally the same as hating America.

c8cy216	21	5	They would just ruin it.
c8cyawg	13	1	Not to mention how the dogs have already "modified" it
c8cykgb	21	5	They have modified the maze. Pray they don't modify it any further.
c8d05gn	2	0	My dad once cleared a path for our dog to poo in through the snow. We all cringed as the paperboy used is as a path to the door. 
c8cy54h	4	1	Yeah, but you're creating precious childhood memories while making cash.

c8czjix	1	0	Making a maze/ring is always fun. I made a big ring around the yard but put big snow mounds through the middle of it with little pathways. Its like trenches and they just raced around the maze/hopped on the mounded snow to find the other one.

c8czrvb	2	0	This isn't 4chan. Grow up.
c8cyv4q	362	31	Does he really not cry?  Some deaf babies don't cry - at least not like hearing babies do... have they had his hearing checked?  
c8czkbh	238	25	There's that depressing post that explains this odd phenomena! 
c8cznat	88	8	It could also be a heart problem. Honestly a non-crying baby could be hundreds of possibly horrible things or nothing at all. Definitely worth a visit to the doctor.

c8czm47	52	6	If he was born in a hospital, I believe it's standard procedure to check newborns' hearing after they pop out.
c8czn2m	28	3	How do you test if a newborn can hear though?
c8czp31	205	19	Scream into its ear.
c8czqvz	74	11	Ah, the scream-into-a-newborns-ear-to-check-its-hearing-ability maneuver. Works every time!
c8d0ix9	7	0	Actually it only works if they can hear.
c8d00kq	8	0	So that's where babies get the idea! Maybe someone forgot to scream at this baby, and he never really thought about doing it because of that. Babies/Kids learn from observation after all.
c8czsf2	24	3	Well, if it wasn't born deaf, I'm sure that procedure is a quick way to fix that problem.

c8czqaw	15	1	They react to sound stimuli.
c8czrno	4	0	I guess that they wait until the baby is asleep and they put crazy headphones on them... And I guess that the baby reacts to the noise they hear in their sleep.  Source:  have a three month old that had this done

c8cxc1p	431	49	fully expected a baby behavior expert to weigh in on why this is bad for the baby and how quickly he should be seen by a physician.. much like the cat who wouldn't eat until he was told it was okay to
c8cy3n0	104	11	What was wrong with the cat?
c8cye8m	404	49	He wouldn't eat until he was told it was okay to.
c8cypgf	207	16	Thanks, that cleared up my confusion.
c8cz2ld	73	8	He was a social eater. I've had a couple of cats like that. They won't finish (or start) their food unless you pet them. I *think* it's related to anxiety.
c8czt6y	20	3	We have a cat that insists you come look at his food before he eats. Is this the same problem?
c8czv7z	36	5	He might be trying to get you to test it to make sure it's not poisoned. Cats are very mistrustful.
c8czwzc	8	2	Huh, interesting. Thanks.
c8cztf5	15	1	what would happen if you left the cat alone with some food for a long time, would he eat eventually or just sit there and starve... which would be both sad and badass. 
c8cytt9	30	3	I see you rolling your eyes. 
c8czsbg	6	0	I think one of the theories were that the cat experienced some kind of abuse in the past. Chewing takes the most develop sense from the cat which is hearing which means that the cat was afraid of any kind of attack if the cat owner wasn't around.

c8czjza	12	0	Someone said the cat just wanted attention and food and it knew how to get both.  Cat's can be manipulative jerks sometimes.
c8czbpc	40	3	Yeah as someone who works with really young kids, this just doesn't feel right to me. OP advise them to talk to the pediatrician with developmental concerns! 
c8czlig	18	2	Wasn't there also a cat that just sat facing the wall all day or something? And everyone was all, "lol cats are so weird!" Then a vet came in and was like, "No he's probably really sick." Then it got sad.
c8czsc0	10	0	It was a cat that was facing a wall with it's forehead pressing directly against the wall.  Everyone thought the cat was being a fucking weirdo until someone said it's a symptom of a serious disease or severe toxic poisoning. 
c8cz168	18	1	Seriously, do you remember what was wrong with the cat? My family adopted an abandoned (possibly abused) cat, and she won't eat until we pet her head and say something like "okay, now eat!"
c8cz3g2	10	0	I did too. His name was Isis. I think it's called social eating but I don't remember where I heard the term. Might be related to anxiety.

c8cyf27	18	8	I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that.
c8cykgy	153	23	I would strongly suggest that they talk to their pediatrician about this ASAP.  I'm not a doctor, but I've read enough flyers to know that this is possibly an early indicator of autism.  
c8czc1z	43	9	My mom didn't cry the entire first year she was born but ended up completely normal (for a mom.) It isn't necessarily an indicator of anything. I'd mention it at the next checkup just to make sure the pediatrician is aware and as a family they can keep an eye out for anything the doctor suggests. But no reason to panic or be too worried.
c8d040d	32	3	&gt;(for a mom.)  I love that.
c8czmna	6	1	My brother did that too. He had FASD, born addicted to crack and had THC in his system when born. Fairly common with that background. 
c8d020n	4	0	Either you're the younger brother and things got way better before you came along, you're the older brother and things went way downhill after you came along, or your brother is adopted and your parents deserve a medal.  I don't know which to believe!
c8d0ebv	4	0	Adopted. We were already in the process of adopting his older brother who was like 4, who she beat and neglected (he learned how to speak from television, i kid you not. Thank god for seinfield)  when all of a sudden the bitch was pregnant so we pressured her to keep the two together. Unfortunately she fucked up his life before he even had one. My parents are exceptional with children with disabilities, both being highly educated in the field as well as professionally active in special education fields.  
c8cyrra	26	25	Meh, possibly...but every baby is different. I've cared for babies that cry constantly and babies that didn't cry until they were 10 weeks old. If the parent is concerned then sure, see your pediatrician but the doctor will probably say "lets wait and see". Also, how would you propose a doctor diagnose/treat autism for an infant?
c8cz6d3	88	5	As a father of a child that was born with heart problems I'd have the doctor check him out ... No crying for my son was due to a coarctation aorta.    
c8cze0b	20	1	&gt;"Meh, possibly..."   Okay, so take him to the physician.

c8czn6d	3	1	Climbing on the bandwagon: Babies are supposed to cry, either something is wrong or the baby is neglected/abused and has learned to not cry (source: NICU Nurse here).  They need to go to the doctors asap.  *Before the E-Knights go ape, I'm not saying the baby is abused, that's just the most common reason babies don't cry.  When they learn they aren't going to be cared for, they stop crying to preserve the energy.

c8cyhg2	2	1	My family owns a cabin in Virginia that used to get mice. We had those glue traps down and we used to see a couple dead mice in them, but thankfully we only ever went down there on weekends so we never had to see them die.
c8czeau	4	0	The Grim Mouse Reaper only works weekdays?
c8cyt39	5	1	I don't think there's any family that actually *likes* rats and mice...
c8cz9bn	7	0	Plenty of people have pet rodents.
c8d0bxg	1	0	I like mice and rats. But not wild ones? Kind of strange.   I once left a cup of kool-ade out overnight, and the next day, I went to dump it, and it had a drowned mouse in it.   Poor Moxie must have heard her mouse cousin drowning, and couldn't' do a thing about it. Makes me really sad.
c8cz1n0	2	0	We had mice and had to use the sticky pads because they were too small to set off a regular mousetrap, and the trap-and-release traps were $15 each... 
c8d0cyt	1	0	My grandmother once found mice in our rice bin. She proceeded to beat them to death with a fly swatter.   "Grammy, stop!!" "SCRAM!"   Love her to death, but she scared the shit out of me.
c8czmz7	2	0	I once worked for a small non-profit org and we had a rat infestation in our building when the warehouse next to us was gutted and all the rats there moved into our building overnight. I'm talking a couple hundred rats. BIG rats. City rats. They were like a moving carpet when you came into the building - it was truly terrifying. The landlord hired an exterminator, who put out a couple dozen of those big trays of glue with a big dollop of peanut butter in the middle of each one. The next day there was a very angry, very alive, very loudly shrieking rat right in the middle of just about every trap. The exterminator went around dumping them into a 5 gallon bucket full of water one at a time, drowning them  It was traumatizing, and I have hated rats ever since.  
c8d0120	1	0	Use the snap traps. They work by crushing the neck of the rat or mouse, which is the most humane way to deal with them.
c8d0e8p	1	0	My family has those on the inside of our garage, and one day while the door was open, a baby hawk got stuck on one. I spent the next hour getting the poor guy free, and while I held him in my hand, afraid whether he would survive or not, he hopped off and away, without so much as a thank-you chirp.  Asshole.
c8cxp9e	10	3	Well it's a good thing they don't hate ants, because that's *exactly* how you get ants

c8cyaz2	1	0	Wtf is "sanitarium", besides a Metallica song?
c8cydze	2	0	They make a cereal called weetbix in Australia, (and I think in New Zealand too)
c8cymxs	1	0	They make a whole bunch of breakfast related items.
c8cz8t9	1	0	A sanitarium is a somewhat defunct term for a mental health facility, though often a "resort" one for rich people.  A famous one in the late 1800s was in Battle Creek Michigan. The head doctor was John Harvey Kellog. He became later famous for his breakfast cereals, which originated with his prescribed diet for his sanitarium residents: lots of cereal, followed by yogurt and water enemas.  Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is an Australia and New Zealand company that originated when a baker for Kellog left Battle Creek, and developed cereals in Australia right around 1900.
c8d04hb	2	0	Wow. As an Australian I never realised that Sanitarium and Kellogg's had a common root.

c8czh1k	1	1	Now THAT'S funny!
c8czh70	1	0	When I had a mouse problem I found the easiest way to catch them was with a toilet paper roll.   You balance it just past its tipping point on the edge of a desk with a peanut butter dab on the overhanging interior side. Mice fuckin' love peanut butter. Underneath is a wastebasket or bucket. When Mr. Mouse crawls in to eat his snack he topples into the bucket with the tube and is caught.  Some people fill the bucket with water so he drowns, but I'd just let them out near neighbours houses whom I didn't like. After all, how can I be so spiteful against the little guys, just doing their thing?  Btw, this post genuinely had me laughing, good work OP, the beetroot root is perfect. 
c8czika	1	0	and soon the beet will attract real mice and rats... win-win for you.
c8czjfi	1	0	i was totally excited to see what a bee troot was haha darn me 
c8czn82	1	0	that's so strange, my family loves them
c8czozh	1	0	May have been said didn't read but I thought beetroots was your pet mouse or a stuffed mouse.    Then I felt dumb.

c8d0h8q	1	0	You... you monster....
c8d0ig1	1	0	Do beetroots repel mice and rats?
c8d0lvk	1	0	I did something like that in my university, but I made it look like a turd with two pieces of some shells from a tree that had a characteristic cylindrical shape (the shell originally stored the seeds from the tree).  The reaction of the people walking by was hilarious.
c8d0sn2	1	0	You're an evil genius and I applaud you 
c8czglm	1	2	Fact: bears eat beats
c8czzeh	1	3	I think you forgot to mention that family hates beetroots. Otherwise I can't explain why finding your beetroots would somehow upset your family.  
c8culhf	234	42	Cigarettes are toxic to dogs. You should take him/her to the vet to be checked.
c8cvehx	257	36	Well let's be fair. They're toxic to humans as well.
c8cxz9i	66	7	No way! I saw an ad from the 50s that said otherwise.
c8cys5y	28	3	You would trust [fucking Mengele here?](http://i.imgur.com/L8Pce3o.jpg)
c8cytdh	31	3	I like how even back then the best argument they could come up with was "*less* irritating". 
c8cz2l1	24	2	"It's toasted."  You got the fucking credentials to argue with that? That, SIR, is a picture of a doctor!
c8czef9	17	1	[This](http://imgur.com/28HfrTM) comes to mind.
c8cznlz	20	2	That's great on so many levels. Notice all the weird illnesses: Dropsy, The Grippe, Rabbit Fever, PLAGUE(!), Bust-Belly. Here's what I imagine they're like:  Dropsy - Lazy eye, but with bleeding.  The Grippe - Causes your toes to clench uncontrollably. Makes picking up things like a monkey difficult.  Rabbit-Fever - Increased libido, tiny little pellet shits.  Bust-Belly - A large cancer-like growth that, nine months later, expels itself out of you and begins sucking away all your free time and youth. 
c8d04i5	2	0	grippe is also a really common name for the flu, surprised you didn't know that one.
c8d087e	4	0	I had no idea. Next year, I'll ask to get my Grippe Shot.
c8czn3n	3	0	well, glad Dr. O'Hara cleared that up for us. wouldn't want to drink some rye and get the plague. 
c8czm8i	1	1	Not sure if this is an actual ad. The first episode of Mad Men had them come up with an ad like this. They may have just based the episode off this ad.
c8czpir	4	0	Lucky Strikes are real, and this is the kind of shit the old ads used to say. I'd believe Madmen just took a famous ad and used it.  Lucky Strikes are also the kind of cigarettes only the manliest of men would smoke. Non-filtered and harsh as hell.
c8cz9uv	5	0	Nah, they [were](http://i.imgur.com/F8ptCBw.jpg) even [braver](http://i.imgur.com/PooDo8G.jpg) than [that](http://i.imgur.com/1kaW1V5.jpg). :)

c8d0jom	3	0	You added an extra, comma.
c8cwx9c	10	0	Oh well, thank god for that!
c8czl0z	8	7	Real talk. Get him checked for heartworms. Arsenic is a treatment for infection. My dog started eating a buddy's cigs everytime he came over. took him to the vet because it was happening so often and it turns out he had heartworms.
c8d00n3	3	0	I would be genuinely interested in why this is getting downvoted. Is it misinformation?
c8d0j1e	4	0	Heart worms are treated with a drug that is arsenic based. Its called immiticide.However, a dog won't eat cigarettes because it has heartworms and knows it needs arsenic.  His buddy's dog was chewing the cigarettes for other reasons (they tasted good?) and it's just a coincidence that the dog was infected. If the vet told him the dog was basically self medicating itself for heart worms, the vet just said it to be nice or to avoid answering an awkward question. And no one better get any "bright ideas" where they think they can treat heart worms with tobacco. It doesn't work that way and you'll end up with a sick or dead dog. 
c8d0mo6	1	0	It just made me wonder if dogs had some kind of a bastardized version of Pica Syndrome--craving something it might be deficient in or needs.  Thanks for the clarity!
c8d0oi3	3	0	I find it incredibly stupid that someone left their cigarettes in mouth-reach of a dog. I find it even more moronic that over 2000 people thought this was funny.
c8d0f0d	3	2	Vets are expensive. If you wanna know if the dog smoked any, just smell his breath.
c8d0njc	1	0	Guffaw...
c8d0kua	2	0	One time, my pug ate a half a pack of cigarettes, a Kit-Kat &amp; a Take 5 bar.  Nothing happened to him.  But he did give me that look, like the dog in the picture.

c8d0toi	1	0	Smoker here. Please, tell me more. I don't think I've ever been exposed to the dangers of smoking, and I'd love to hear reddit's stance on it.
c8cyzuj	3	1	I'm sure they're toxic to people too...
c8cz7qt	4	2	Yes, I know that all too well... My Granddaddy died of lung cancer.
c8d05f8	3	0	That's unfortunate but it's not entirely the same thing. Eating cigarettes will kill you much more quickly than waiting around for lung cancer from smoking them. 
c8cz96u	3	1	I'm sorry to hear that man. My gramps is on the same track. 
c8czxml	4	0	My grandfather died in a mine collapse.
c8d033v	1	0	Fuck now I'm sad. 
c8cxzq7	31	2	That's one of the guiltiest looking dogs I've ever seen. He knows exactly what he did. 
c8d03sv	1	0	Or, he wishes he had opposable thumbs to light the lighter. :(
c8d0jk2	1	0	Haven't you ever seen Dener?
c8cze9f	5	7	He's probably just responding to his owner's behaviour. He knows he's done something wrong because his owner is mad at him; the first inkling a dog has that he's done something wrong is that he's being punished.
c8czqix	18	0	I don't think that's typical.  I used to come home from school to find the dog had done something bad like get into the garbage or poop indoors (we had a doggy door, but he didn't like to go out when it was below 60).  Whenever I walked in the house I'd immediately know something was wrong because he wouldn't greet me at the door.  Instead he'd be hiding in a closet or something with his head down, even without anyone at the house.  Dogs know.
c8d005s	5	0	Agreed, dogs know when they have done something wrong (provided they have been taught that it is wrong in the past). 
c8d0jw1	1	0	Mine is the same! She likes to steal loaves of bread off the counter. If we walk in the house and she doesn't greet us at the door, we start looking for what she got into. It never fails.
c8czqg0	3	9	That is a common misconception. 
c8cwp9t	26	2	Most of the nicotine in a cigarette is burned away. A full sized man would die if he ate a whole pack. A baby would probably keel over from 1 or 2 
c8cyh2v	13	0	Actually, a full sized man would die die after about 5.
c8cze7u	23	2	thats twice as bad as just normal die!
c8d03xx	6	0	I'm just going to leave that there.
c8d01vk	2	0	No, it was just an echo^echo^echo^echo^echo
c8d071r	1	0	Yeah I was thinking from past readings that you wouldn't even make it to a full pack before kicking it. I heard it was four, but five works too. 
c8d0fnx	1	0	&gt;About five  That's close enough to four, right? Also, I find it ironic that I'm talking about cigarettes with someone who's username is "newport100"

c8czst0	3	0	The cigarette companies control the amount of nicotine in each type and brand of tobacco products. 
c8d07rb	2	0	But we don't swallow it, which is where the problem lies. If you pack a lip and start swallowing your spit, you'll get sick pretty quickly.

c8czsi9	1	1	Good Boy Dog. I hate that I made a name for a meme. 
c8d0uol	1	0	Yeah, better the dog directly eat and partially digest something toxic than a person smoke!
c8d08ye	4	0	Time to sit the dog down and make it smoke a whole carton it needs to know cigarettes are not a joke.
c8cy8zk	7	1	Can I rent this dog to help me quit smoking?
c8czxpy	4	1	As a general rule of thumb you should buy a pet to solve every major problem in life. If you're married, having children serves the same purpose.   Source: my parents
c8d0501	5	0	This... this is the worst advice ever.

c8cwkpn	10	6	Might as well replace "subreddit" with internet and "1 gif" with cats...
c8cwpgp	5	2	At least there are different cats, cat pictures, cat videos, etc. /r/TheStopGirl is one gif used over and over with a different title.

c8d0fbi	2	0	/r/thestopgirl
c8d0tcm	1	1	Ok, I seriously need someone to help me out here. I want to believe that she is saying "stop", but no matter how hard I try, I cannot say the word "stop" without bringing my lips together at the end of the word (to make the 'p' sound). It's pretty clear that she does not do so, since she starts laughing before her mouth closes. On the other hand, the first sound looks like an 'st' sound, so I don't think she's saying "no". So, is she saying "staaaa" and then it turns into laughter? Does anyone else have any ideas? Any linguists on Reddit?

That's how they get you. They got my friends, all of them. John, Allie, Mitch... All of them.  I don't have much time, I'm getting out of town. I suggest you do the same. I'm in the car now, don't worry about me though, save yourself. And no, I'm not texting and driving, I'm at a stop... sign.  Oh God Brover, it's too late. I hope you make it out. God speed.   Don't stop. Stop and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can  believe. Don't put on the brakes. Don't yield. and don't stop. Good luck.

I may not understand it. I may not even necessarily agree with it. But I'll tell you what I've accepted: just sort of glide along. You want to keep things on an even key, this is what I'm saying. You want to go with the flow. The sea refuses no river. The idea is to remain in a state of constant departure while always arriving. It saves on introductions and goodbyes. The ride does not require explanation - just occupants. That's where you guys come in. It's like you come onto this planet with a crayon box. Now you may get the 8 pack, you may get the 16 pack but it's all in what you do with the crayons - the colors - that you're given. Don't worry about coloring within the lines or coloring outside the lines - I say color outside the lines, you know what I mean? Color all over the page; don't box me in!

Well the first band was playing and they were a hard rock/metal band and there were some dudes up front doing so really exhagerated and ridiculous head banging/noshing. Well the security guy was like right in the edge observing it and he had a funny look on his face as he watched the people. I opened up a notepad on my phone a spelled "white people" in big letter and held it up for him to see. When he glanced over and saw it he smiled and laughed pretty hard. Pretty much made my night

c8cze2g	4	3	Haha! Well here in the states 10 years ago it cost $130 or so to change it. There was a three month "waiting period" to make sure I wasn't changing it to defraud anyone and then the judge approved it and I had a brand new first middle and last name! =)
c8czerb	2	0	So I would need to find a judge who likes Star Trek... Hmmmm....   Or perhaps one who doesn't know anything about Trek and they wouldn't know what I was doing.
c8czire	5	1	I don't think in the U.S. anyway they care much what you change your name to as long as it isn't to dodge creditors. But in Iceland (for example) you have to choose your baby's name from a [list of approved ones.] (http://www.nordicnames.de/wiki/Icelandic_Names) But at least that way parents can't use names like Hitler.

Haha, oh Dr. Dre.  &gt;According to Rolling Stone reporter Alan Light: "He picked her up and "began slamming her leg and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway" as his bodyguard held off the crowd. After Dre tried to throw her down the stairs and failed, he began kicking her in the ribs and hands. She escaped and ran into the women's rest room. Dre followed her and "grabbed her from behind by the hair and proceeded to punch her in the back of the head."   &gt;As Dr. Dre explained the incident, "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fuck with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain't nothing you can do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain't no big thing-- I just threw her through a door."  &gt;*Light, Alan. "Beating Up the Charts." Rolling Stone, 8 August 1991. p66.*

c8cw6kt	348	72	Doing that to a Doberman's ears is kinda dickish.  Studies show that it is exceptionally painful for them.
c8cwwvh	163	41	I agree. I already don't care about the joke because cropping a dog's ears is completely unnecessary and purely for the benefit of the owner's own cosmetic wishes.

c8cy02s	97	67	This needs more attention.  Everyone is soooo pissed that a dog got a bit of his EAR cut off, but bring up circumcision, and every one is like "naw it's ok, it's just a minor cosmetic thing." 
c8d06w1	5	1	I'll be honest. Being circumcised has impacted my life exactly 0 times.
c8cybpm	89	36	My wiener got chopped on as a baby and it wasn't so bad. I like it now its like it has a permanent skin haircut, and it can see what I'm slamming it into easier. 
c8cz9kr	6	0	I'm guessing you have a stiffy when you slam your genitals into things so the foreskin shouldn't obstruct vision too much.
c8czfn5	13	1	Honestly you'd be surprised what I try to work with
c8cyh0b	51	34	Yea I don't remember it at all. What's all the fuss 
c8cyqsv	61	32	People rustling up unnecessary controversy cause they're bored.
c8cyu1u	47	17	I just think it's weird that we as a society decided to chop off a piece of everyone's dick.
c8cz7d4	17	1	Not everyone's. Try coming at me with scissors and I'll cut you.  ...is that ironic?
c8czdq6	19	5	And any of us who are happy they had it done should just be ignored.
c8czfa4	16	10	For permanent things that can be done at any point, it's safer to wait at least until the person can talk before forcing it on them. IMHO
c8czwdh	5	3	It was so painful that you had to block out the first 3 years of your life. This is why no one remembers being an infant.
c8d0fxj	2	0	I got the "permanent hair cut" when I was nine and know both sides of the story,truly it becomes a little bit less sensitive but other than that there is no real difference, except the pain of being done for me as a nine year old
c8d0u1k	1	0	You can do that when retracted but for those cold days you have a nice turtle neck sweater but for your penis.
c8d05up	4	1	Actually, it's been shown to have a significant benefit in reducing the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.  So much so that when a study was done where they monitored the rates of contraction and transmission among a circumsized group and an uncircumsized group, they had to call off the experiment and circumsize the rest of the men because it was unethical to not allow them to be circumsized since it was so effective.  But that's just like, science's opinion, man.
c8d0by8	1	0	Though how much that study in Africa applies to developed nations is up to debate.  After all, women here don't use cornstarch to dry out their vaginas to avoid allegations of infidelity (in some cultures getting wet is seen as "slutty"), and hygiene and clinical treatment of "gateway" STDs is a little different here.  Something that has an effect in one population doesn't necessarily in another...  This is why even experts cannot agree on this topic.
c8cytr7	14	5	Welcome to humans.
c8cz5ys	7	3	double, triple, and quadruple standards abound...
c8cykse	25	11	as some one who was circumcized last year, i'd rather it had been done when i was a bay and it could be done cheaply with out interfering with 25 years of my life
c8cza2l	3	1	Is there any difference sexually? People are saying here girls like it without the hoodie. isnt the hoodie supposed to go back when its hard? 
c8czel1	13	1	Can confirm, the hoodie goes back when hard. 
c8czir1	6	1	Thats what Im saying. it just goes back. Ive never heard a girl say, "ewww, your hoodie is bothering me, were not doing this anymore". 
c8czjoi	10	1	... I have :( she had apparently never seen an uncircumcised dick before and asked if it was diseased. Hurt my feels bro 
c8czm1q	3	1	aweh dude, im sorry. i dont know how shed think that thou? it is just a flap of skin that goes back and you cant even really tell when it goes back. 
c8d0g05	2	0	Dafuq? Do you live in a shtetl?
c8d0ku6	2	0	Aww. She obviously didn't care much for you to exercise some tact in the bedroom.  I wasn't at all familiar with a circumcised penis when I had sex with my boyfriend for the first time, but I loved him and wasn't focused on the look so much as what he and I were about to do. Now I can honestly say I like it better uncircumcised. 
c8cyort	15	8	ok, it might be inconvenient for you, but think of the other side of the coin. you now have no foreskin, but wish you did, how do you fix it?
c8cyt91	19	5	There's people like that?
c8cyude	10	6	there are many... http://www.foreskinrestoration.info/
c8cz0yn	8	7	huh... weird. Just saying, that women like the D without the sweater. But I also have so say that that is case by case. In my experience though, I would prefer to have the circumcision and they don't get the same sensation otherwise. To each their own.
c8czcfg	10	2	I think you will find that women in places where circumcision is not normal tend to like the sweater.  Also circumcision reduces pleasure for both the male and the female during sex.  All because good old Kellog didn't want you to wank.
c8cytkl	37	22	Hell, it happened to me, I don't remember, and hell, I like it, and my girlfriend sure as hell likes it. Nobody likes the taste of smegma.
c8cyzgn	23	2	A penis you don't keep clean will accumulate smegma, circumcised or not.
c8cyvdv	48	13	I don't like the taste of toe jam, but go for the less drastic measure of just cleaning my feet instead of cutting off my toes.
c8cz8rl	11	0	Yea, it isnt that hard to wash your dick. Like washing anything else. 
c8czi3m	9	1	And if you wash it enough at one time... JACKPOT!
c8cyyxk	17	2	couldn't of said it better myself. wash your dick! foreskin or no foreskin!
c8cyzbu	17	15	Washing your dick once a day is too hard for Jews I guess. 
c8d08pk	4	0	That escalated quickly. 
c8czucf	5	2	Well, time *is* money
c8d0eoj	1	0	Hell, you sound like a hillbilly
c8czdr7	2	0	If they just put a rubber band on it and just let it fall off I think people would be singing a different tune.
c8cz8cv	2	1	Isnt it cleaner thou? I dont have mine chopped off completely. My friend said its like my dick is wearing a little hoodie. 
c8czeeb	4	3	It's not completely chopped off? Is it just dangling on a thread?  It might be cleaner. But would you cut off your nose to get rid of boogers?
c8czddi	9	6	Except... We're not talking about circumcision FFS!  If this was a threat about such things, then yes, appropriate.  But this is about docking a dog's ears.  Good lords this is one of the most irksome things about reddit.   If you want to raise a bitch up about circumcision, there are thousands of topics *ABOUT CIRCUMCISIONS* here on reddit.  No freaking need to bring up this debate in a thread that has *NOTHING* to do with it...  And I'm quite sure people who are upset (myself included) about docking the dog's ears is equally upset about snipping a baby boy's tip.  Sheesh..
c8czh5k	7	3	in theory this thread should be about a funny video of a dog chomping some poor schmuck on the junk, but SOOOMMME PEOPLE just HAD to make it about docking...
c8czi7g	2	0	Indeed... have an upvote.
c8cyk5v	18	17	Actually that is not true. The American Journal of Pediatrics found that the cutting off of the foreskin has more health benefits than risks associated with the procedure. http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/08/27/159955340/pediatricians-decide-boys-are-better-off-circumcised-than-not
c8cz9nd	6	0	The only legitimate reason stated is to prevent urinary track infection.  Debate that as you will, but STD prevention is straight up stupid.  If you're circumcised, are you just gonna assume you never get STDs? No, that makes no sense.  Doing it unprotected will still get you STDs, chopped dick or not.
c8d0d99	1	0	I think the STD point is mainly for underdeveloped countries where access to condoms is limited. 
c8czjng	4	0	There are also vets that tout that declawing is a great decision. That doesn't make them ethical, that makes them money-hungry.
c8cz0cw	8	6	Since pediatricians have a vested interest in circumcisions, I'm more hesitant to trust them. Why would our body be born with stuff that needs to be taken off?   The appendix/wisdom teeth is because our diets have changed but sex is pretty much the same. The danger from a foreskin (if there is any) can be offset with the use of a condom.
c8czlcz	1	0	Even worse if it's only done half-way and you end up with a dinged up donger.
c8czn5g	1	0	Dock off that dinged up donger!
c8d0mmm	1	0	Reddit: where a funny gif of a dog and turn into a discussion on circumcision in 3 comments flat.  *slowclap
c8d0ouk	1	0	It was done to me, I don't care that it was done to me, I don't remember it at all, and I honestly *don't give a single shit* whether or not someone else does it to their kid.  Hell, the annoyance of this issue popping up in a thread where it doesn't belong actually invokes a more powerful emotional response in me than the issue itself.  ***Now bring on the downvotes, my body is ready.***
c8cx8gq	15	10	Kinda like breeding new dog races.
c8cxg1e	9	5	It used to be we would breed for certain traights that we actually needed to help us survive.   Edit: Traits. Dafuq. Where am I? 
c8cy1m7	2	1	We still do.    http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doberman_Pinscher 
c8cy78b	12	3	Breeding a dog for useful traits like for police training or hunting is fine. But I think breeding a dog to make it as tiny as possible, then label it "teacup" or "mini" is just useless and also tends to lead to immune issues and congenital diseases. 
c8cyhgi	4	0	It was the useful kind I was referring to.  For instance, although they have now become a fashionable cross and aren't really a true breed yet, labradoodles were originally bred for a specific purpose ie to be seeing-eye dogs for blind ppl who also had dog allergies.  Poodle fur is quite different from many other breeds and ppl with dog hair allergies are often fine with them.  However, in terms of temperament, while poodles are very intelligent they are also very inquisitive and didn't necessarily make good guide dogs, although I have seen a few.  So crossing poodles with labradors resulted in pups with a sort-of hypo-allergenicish fur and the even temperament suitable for an assistance dog. :)
c8cyjds	3	0	Oh I definitely agree on the poodle fur part. I'm allergic to dander and since my dog is a Cavachon (cavalier King Charles spaniel and Bichon frise) I can actually have the joy of owning a dog. And I never new that about labradoodles, that's actually really awesome. 
c8d0bw2	1	0	That curious because I heard spaniels especially are very bad for allergics.  We had a CKCS puppy for a while but my mom, who is allergic, couldn't even stay in the same room without having her eyes red and teary. Later we got an Old English Sheepdog who lived with her for 11 years and no symptoms whatsoever. Yes it's just a one story and there's more than one degree of allergy, just wanted to mention it as an example.  Also my allergic friends say spaniels are definitely the worst. I've always been told it's not the *fur* but the *dander* that's at fault. Does your dog have more of a Bichon Frise fur and skin?
c8czcme	1	0	Yea. Ive seen a lotta those little dogs come into the animal hospital I work at. they are fucked up. bad joints, heart murmurs, i feel bad for em. THeyve been compromised and have lots of issues later on because well, someone didnt breed them correctly and they were bred in the first place to achieve that goal of tiny, while compromising their health and well being. 
c8czlnv	1	0	Meanwhile there are also breeders like those for Olde English Bulldogges that are trying to "restore" old school breeds who have modern descendants that have been completely fucked over. 
c8cwhk1	85	18	Really? Cutting a hunk of their ears off is painful? Who would've fucking thought?  Edit: I had my ear cut half off when I had a cholesteatoma or however the fuck its spelled so I am not unsympathetic to the dog
c8cwxv1	10	2	I can confirm this. Recovery was a bitch saying it was on the side I slept on...
c8cx0cz	11	1	Same here. One of the most painful things I've ever gone through, particularly because I decided to go back to work after sleeping it off for like 2 days. I have no recollection of making that decision because I was so drugged up, but apparently I did. Next thing I remember is throwing a box of frozen dough on each shoulder, and hitting that ear. That broke through the drug haze. 
c8cytue	3	0	Me too. Worst part is, the fucking doctor trying to removed a stuck ear tube (I was 6) was the reason it got there. I have a half as high hearing test score on the side it was growing in. 
c8cxx0i	3	0	I'm a little confused by you saying you had your ear cut half off due to a cholesteatoma because I too had this and my ear is quite intact. I did have prosthetic bones put into my inner ear, but I am confused by how you lost half your ear.
c8cytp3	3	0	I didn't lose it, but the incision was across the whole back of my ear, and they sort of peeled it back to reach my middle ear. From there they removed my ear canal, my bone there (can't remember the name but it starts with an m) and had to scrape it off of my facial nerve and some artery. The guy who did it published a paper about it because he has never seen so large a cholesteatoma in someone so young. I have never been able to find the paper and I always forget to ask when I see the surgeon. In any case a large one is the size of a pea, and mine was the size of a ping pong ball. The ear was sewn back when he was done, but it was at least 50% separated during the surgery. 
c8d0khe	1	0	Ah now I understand. I too have the large scar behind my ear where they had to open me up, but fortunately I was young and it has almost completely faded in the 12 or 13 years since my surgery. I had 2 bones replaced in my ear. That sounds absolutely awful having to go through that. I guess I'm lucky they caught mine at a reasonable time and that my hearing in my left ear is within the normal range, although not as good as my right ear.
c8cwqv9	29	16	Really? Could you direct me to a few of them? I'm honestly curious, most of what I've seen online suggests that cropping is generally not very traumatic for dogs.  THAT SAID: I'm not a fan of cropping, and I would never have my dog's ears/tail cropped (/docked?). I'm trying to have an informed opinion, and saying "it seems mean" is not a valid objection to something like this. Hence asking for studies. It's also worth noting that there _are_ legitimate reasons for cropping ears: more precise hearing may not seem like all that much, but for what it's worth (and purely anecdotally), my mom's elderly dobermaan with uncropped ears semi-frequently gets lost in the park because he can't figure out where her voice is coming from when she calls him. Would docked ears necessarily solve that? Maybe, maybe not. Still worth thinking about.
c8cxjj3	20	4	YOU WANT PROOF? BLASPHEMY!!!!  /s
c8cxnbs	13	1	The Wikipedia articles on both practices are fairly thorough.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(dog)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropping_(animal)  Both are illegal in many countries, and any surgery (especially amputation, I would imagine) has the potential for pain. Especially considering that some breeders will (legally, in the US) crop/dock their puppies' ears and tails without anesthesia.  Additionally, dogs use their ears and tails as their primary form of communication with other dogs.  [This page](http://kb.rspca.org.au/Why-is-the-RSPCA-opposed-to-the-tail-docking-of-dogs_135.html) from the Australian RSPCA goes into more detail.
c8cxu0l	9	5	Some points, in no particular order:  * I'm mostly interested in the ethics of cropping, less so the legality.   * My impression is that when anesthetic-less croppings are normally done when a puppy is young enough that it literally doesn't does not have nerve endings in its tail. Total hearsay, mind, but that's my understanding.   * An interesting note, apparently dobermaans with with cropped ears have a significantly lower chance of getting an ear infection compared to a dog with uncropped ears. Apparently, these can be quite painful for the dog.  The bit about communication was interesting; I'd never really considered that. 
c8cym78	6	0	* If you read the sections on legality in both Wikipedia articles, they address the ethical issues as well. For example,   &gt;The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the regulatory body for veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom, has said that they consider tail docking to be "an unjustified mutilation and unethical unless done for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons".  (Docking)  &gt;American veterinary schools do not generally teach cropping and docking, and thus veterinarians who perform the practice have to learn on the job.[4] There are also problems with amateurs performing ear-cropping, particularly at puppy mills.[4] Amateur cropping is not illegal in the United States. However, the Indiana Appellate Court described a situation that escalated into a prosecutable animal cruelty case in these terms:  &gt;"During the procedure, Elisea had an assistant bind the dogs' legs and mouths with tape. Once immobilized, Elisea marked a line along each ear with an eyeliner pencil and, after numbing the ears with ice, but without any anesthetic, cut the dogs' ears with a pair of office scissors. Vaseline and Bactine were placed on each cut, and Elisea told [the owner] to keep the puppies outside in the cold because their ears would heal more quickly."[15]  (Cropping, though not from the section on legality.)   * Why would a young puppy not have nerve endings in its tail?   &gt; Tail docking is generally done on two- to 10-day-old puppies, without anesthesia. The cut goes through skin, cartilage, **nerve endings** and bone. Proponents believe very young puppies do not feel pain during docking. They believe canines are less developed than other animals at birth, with less sensitive nervous systems.  &gt;Opponents of tail docking, including the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), disagree. They maintain **puppies, just like human babies, have a fully developed nervous system and do indeed feel pain.** They point to biological markers, which show pain is occurring during and after a procedure such as tail docking.  (Emphasis mine.) [Source](http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2010/01/27/is-tail-docking-and-ear-cropping-harmful-to-dogs.aspx)  * Your third point requires more research; I've heard anecdotal evidence on both sides. It seems to me that it's better  to *not* put the dog through painful surgery before finding out if it's necessary. If the dog proves to be prone to ear infections, and a vet feels that cropping is necessary to relieve and prevent them, then by all means get it done. But why should dogs who will never have an ear infection in their life have to go through that? I'm pretty sure there are less-drastic alternatives to ear infections, as well.
c8czapa	1	0	That description of the ear docking was incredibly distressing. In fairness, that's an argument against amateur dockings; I should hope that no one would argue that _any_ docking is fine. Reading that, though, it's tempting to say that the risk of people like that docking a dog's ears is enough to outweigh any possible gain.  I did a quick google search for the nervous system bit (which I really should have done earlier), and found some conflicting information. I think it is generally accepted that puppies are born with an immature nervous system, but there are disagreements about what exactly the implications of that are. Frustratingly, I wasn't able to find (in the admittedly relatively brief period I spent looking) any scholarly works on the subject; WSAVA did a study, but I haven't been able to find any more details about their methods or results. Whether justified or not, I find myself as skeptical of it as I am of the letter from a fairly respectable-sounding veterinarian posted on the Council of Docked Breeds [site.](http://www.cdb.org/vets/fritsch.htm)  I agree with you in a general sense that ear/tail docking as a preventive surgery seems very off, but I'd be interested in more information before coming to a more solid opinion.
c8cyjx9	4	1	Not to be a dick, but if anybody body part has the chance of infection, do we go around cutting them off or ripping them off? No. Ear infections suck in humans, as do tooth aches or chest infections or infected in-grown toe nails. The list goes on. 
c8cypi2	3	1	Appendix.   Sorry, I know that's a shitty comparison. You're right, but I really feel like comparing humans to dogs with regards to things like this isn't really fair.   My point with bringing that up was just to point out that there ARE benefits. One person suggested that an ear infection would cause a dog more pain than the cropping process; while I don't know if that is true, if you're trying to find the net utility for something like that, this _is_ something that needs to be considered.
c8cys64	2	0	I totally understand the point you were going for, but in reality, it's a shitty cosmetic practice and it doesn't need to be done for any practical reason. As mentioned above or below, other dogs have floppy ears but don't get mutilated. People just look after their pets. You want a specific breed? Take the pros can cons of owning that wonderful creature is all that really needs to be said.
c8cx48i	8	3	I hate the whole docking and cutting practice. When we got a pure bread boxer we requested the breeders didn't cut anything (not gonna show him or anything), and his tail was gone. Apparently don't cut if only reference to the ears.
c8d0tkk	1	0	The whole reason people do it is so that the dog can not show it's emotions as well towards other dogs. In turn, it can produce a more aggressive dog, and more aggressive behavior from other dogs.   It's disgusting.

c8cw4wk	393	99	Eh.  If the guy who got it in the balls is the owner, I'd say he deserves it for docking his dog's ears.
c8cwx25	124	12	He looks like a kid... about 12-14 years old.
c8cx5vf	107	6	So basically the guy who's docking the ears is the guy who uses the laser pointer as a remote control to make the dog bite his son's balls.   Probable scenario. Not the only possible scenario, mind you...but so, so plausible. 
c8cyv8f	33	4	Also could be a dickhead older brother.  Source: Former dickhead older brother.
c8cz595	5	0	So, you're a former dickhead who's still an older brother, or a former older brother who's still a dickhead? Or maybe it's both. The loss of all your younger siblings resulted in you stopping your dickhead ways, so you're a former dickhead former older brother.
c8czi8q	4	0	Former dickhead, still older brother. Matured, started supporting them + standing up for them when need be. Scaring off the bullies, etc. I feel bad but they know.

c8cz7v8	2	0	Can confirm dickhead older brother possibility.  Source: Younger sibling of dickhead older brother.
c8cxc1b	13	3	Yea, that dog does seem a little old to just have his ears docked.
c8cymb7	10	4	The ear casts are actually supposed to be there, if I'm correct, the Doberman Pincher's ears need to perked up when in early life or else their hearing can be damaged for the rest of their life. I have seen this on all Doberman Pincher pups. I mean, come on I have to be a reliable source, look at my username
c8d0ff2	1	1	They only do this for docking
c8cx9nb	34	25	if I recall correctly from when this was originally posted, the ears were injured (or something) rather than having been docked.
c8cxj9j	103	45	Well, that's is an amazing coincidence, how both ears were injured at once in such a similar way that they had to have identical bandaging, and there are no other indications of injury elsewhere.  I mean, it would be one thing if the owner had a specific reason to lie, such as trying to keep everybody from hating him for cutting up a healthy dog for cosmetic reasons. It's a good thing that we've kept the internet a "lie free" zone. Otherwise, we'd have to rely on common sense and go with the only obvious explanation.
c8cxmfp	79	9	Guitly until proven innocent, you tell that gif what's up
c8cy46u	31	37	Let's imagine that I linked you this picture of an orange: http://i.imgur.com/2wuBJ.jpg  Interestingly, although it looks like an apple, the truth is that it's just an orange that has been made to look like an apple.  Now, you might say that I'm a liar and that's just a picture of an apple. But you see, that would make me "guilty until proven innocent". You're not allowed to use your own judgement based on the evidence you're seeing in the image itself. You have to rely on what I say, even if it's implausible.
c8cy8aw	24	7	that's a pretty nice orange you've got there
c8cyd8d	10	5	Yep, it's one damn fine peach.
c8cye8h	26	9	that is the stupidest thing i've read today.
c8cz0s8	3	0	You are comparing different items, not the events that could have led to a state. Perhaps a better analogy for your point would be.  Let's say I told you this apples grew underground like a potato. Now although it looks like a normal apple from a tree, the truth is it was bioengineered to grow underground.  Now, you might say that I'm a liar and that's just a normal apple. But you see, that would make me "guilty until proven innocent".  You have to rely on what I say, even though I just wrote the most retarded thing you have read all day.  But this is all irrelevant as I am an expert on apples.
c8d0gnm	1	0	You just repeated exactly what I said. There is literally no difference between the logic behind your example and the logic behind mine. I claimed that an orange was "made to look like an apple." That would qualify for your standard of "events that could have led to a state."  But that's beside the point, isn't it? Since you obviously understand the point behind my comment, I have to infer that your comment is intended to disagree with the entire line of reasoning. However, I don't see anything like an argument about that in your comment. Just some name calling. Can you please elaborate on your point?
c8d0qoa	1	0	I was just trying to make a more sense able analogy to a point that was irrelevant

c8cyjbv	7	5	I was trying to think of what to tag him while reading his comment, thank you for solving that for me.
c8cylop	21	4	No really, the ears were both injured... by a scalpel in a vet's office.  
c8cy64t	11	8	Dogs do have a tendency to bite the ears and tear them up bad when they get in fights with one another.  I once had two boxers that did not get along at all, and one of them ended up losing a chunk of his ear before we could find another home for him.
c8cybxg	13	5	That's true. My point was about how both ears were hurt in a similar way and there are no other marks on the dog.
c8cwesf	31	42	But it looks way cooler. /s  Edit: /s means sarcasm. That means I was joking. I hope that clears things up. I love dogs and my parents breed boxers and did this to their first dog and was incredibly painful to watch and I can only imagine how bad it was for the dog. That was the first and last time they did it too their dogs due to the shitty experience. 
c8cwjrm	20	16	Well you can eat a bag of dicks :P /s
c8cwmmb	23	7	Do I eat the whole bag at once? Or eat each dick individualy?
c8cwy7u	7	0	Are they just laying in a bag or are they standing up like baguettes?
c8cx2y2	7	0	They're layered like jenga blocks
c8cw7g7	12	1	ummm what the fuck is on that dog's ears?
c8cwa7s	31	8	Dobermans are actually born with big, floppy ears. To get the traditional Doberman "look," the ears are "docked," i.e. cut short to shape.   Owners and vets who do it claim it helps keep the ears free of infection, but I really don't know about that. 
c8cwvt4	40	5	So is this like canine circumcision?  
c8cy33u	9	9	No, that's different, because it's cultural. Genital mutilation is okay.
c8cwzhn	30	16	It does help prevent infections. My Doberman's wears used to get filthy and so many things inside his ears before they were cropped. I wish there was a better way to do it but  I don't think it's the worst 
c8cxife	14	9	That logic doesn't explain why other breeds with longer ears are not docked to "prevent infection" - what a silly concept.   You know what else prevents infections? Cleaning them.   Docking is cosmetic, plain and simple. 
c8d0d65	3	0	My dog's ears aren't docked, and like all dogs I can think of are naturally floppy. (Because dogs were bred from wolves, not jackals)  He has never gotten an ear infection, what he does get alot are grass darts stuck in his earholes. Surely this would be much more dangerous if his ears were docked?  Also, what excuses do they use for clipping their tales. In short, I fully agree, there is no obvious utility, it's just cosmetic.
c8cx2qm	32	27	The best way to do it is clean your dogs ears and not hack them off because you're a lazy owner. Had three growing up and had to clean out their ears at least twice a week and now have to do the same thing with my pits. 
c8cx6aj	18	5	Agreed. I had a lab and there's not much that's appreciably different about Dobermans' ears when they are left natural. You just need to get in there from time to time and clean the gunk out. Nobody sees the need to cut up the ears of labs or Golden Retrievers or whatever, but the excuse for Dobermans and German Shepherds is that it's for sanitary purposes. Just like Harley guys saying that having a loud exhaust is important to help people to know they're there and not merge into them. No, it's because you think it's bad ass.
c8cxtn5	10	2	Some dogs get chronic yeast infections in the ears. I had a lab where the vet advised a crop because they were always constantly getting fucked up from the infections. She was a happier dog for it. It's not as cut and dry as "the owner is lazy" Some dogs have ear issues. I also believe many of these protection type breeds had the crops and docs because it was less of something that could be grabbed/torn off by a perp. Maybe it's for vanity now a lot of the time, but it was functional at one point and for the dog's benefit.
c8cy0i8	4	0	I totally get that. But I think it's mostly for looks. My lab would get yeast infections if I wasn't an attentive owner, and I think that folks use that as an excuse to alter their dogs' ears. Realistically, dogs are property and folks can do with them as they like within reason (ie, not go all Vick on their dogs), but I'm just not a fan of altering the dog from stock. Of course, then you get into the question of breeding them to change the basic nature of the animal, but that's a larger discussion.  Flip side, as a male I was altered shortly after birth for hygienic reasons, and ~40 years later I don't have any trauma over the matter, so....
c8czmw6	1	0	Well it wasn't a matter of not being attentive enough in our case. Some animals just get a bad draw with stuff like that. It wasn't the norm as I've had many dogs with out this issue.
c8d0d6w	1	0	German Shepherds don't get their ears cropped. They naturally stand up...  Dobermans were originally bred as a protective dog. They were bred by a tax collector who needed a "bodyguard" to help him with his collecting. They were bred for strength and ferocity, above other things. The ear cropping helped add to that ferocity. Now a days the doberman isn't bred for ferocity, however, the cropping of the ears became a staple for the breed, and stuck around despite the fact that the majority of dobermans bred today are extremely friendly, and actually make terrible protectors.  Comparing a golden retriever to a doberman isn't a fair assessment as to why labs, etc don't have their ears cropped.  Tail docking has roughly the same history as ear cropping, except I think certain breeds can and do still benefit from it. The doberman being one of them. Breeds with long, thin tails can run into problems of injuring their tail by banging it off of something. A dobermans tail is very thin, and very long. When dogs get excited, they wag their tail. And if it bangs into a wall over and over, the damage be extremely detrimental to the dogs health.
c8cxijy	7	7	Loud pipes save lives, bud.
c8cxvjh	2	0	I know that dogs who have floppy ears are, in fact, prone to more infection because it is harder for air and what have you to get in there. We had a family friend who had a fog with floppy ears, who used to give her dog ear drops if they became infected.   However, if you keep an eye on it and clean them our regularly, I'm pretty sure they're fine. I don't believe in the idea of cropping either, but to each their own. They'll get theirs someday.

c8cubjo	6	4	That has got to be one of the worst ways to wake up.
c8cvl8q	11	7	No the worst way to wake up is hungover, seeing an nude album of pictures of you on Facebook, finding out you got married to a some Asian man and you divorced your wife. And this is all before you get out of bed, which is in fact, a bunk bed. You're on the top and don't notice, and fall onto the ground which is covered in venomous Asps. The only weapon you have to fight is your broken arm and some shard of broken teeth. That is the *worst* way to wake up.   **Brought to you by the *Hangover 4* Adwizards**
c8cyiq5	1	1	I can't wait for the Hangover franchise to move into horror territory. Like Stu wakes up in a bathroom with both legs amputated and his arms broken behind his back, with Doug's dead body propped up in the corner. All that remains is a bloodied steak knife lying in the corner near a locked door. A bleached jaw bone with PHIL scrawled on it in Sharpie sits in another corner. Now, Stu has to find out: what *did* happen last night?
c8czt25	2	0	My cat used to hang out at the foot of the bed like a civilized pet.   But every once in a while the 'lil bastard would be in a playful mood, and pounce on the source of the farting noise and try to kill it.  Not good when you are sleeping on your back.

c8cvdrf	139	24	Good thing you put a big red circle around the pin otherwise I would have missed it!!! Good on you, OP
c8cw6iy	25	22	Might be so it's easier to fake.  So let's say he started with either one of the pictures of the cat messing around with the tack, or even only with a storyline. The rest of the tack pictures can be done by rubbing the tack in something that smells nice for a cat (fish/meat) - the cat will now be intensely interested. The picture of the cat putting her head in the shoe is *very* easily done by putting a cat treat in there.  So, why fake just the last image then? It might be relatively difficult to get the "spacing" between shoe and cat right, without the cat already having her head inside. Maybe he already had a pic of the cat next to his shoe, maybe he just didn't have the tack in there yet when he took the picture. In any case it makes it much easier to edit the tack in with that red circle around, because then he just needed to take another pic of it inside the shoe from a relatively similar angle, cut out that part to put it in the shoe+cat picture and overpaint the cut in red.  
c8cwanb	35	4	Seriously?

c8cxhxg	2	0	Cats are weird. I can see a cat doing this as some sort of "bringing home a prize" behavior. 
c8cy1a7	1	0	I can explain the tack pulling thing. Cats just like to mess around with things. I had a cat that would always pull tacks out of my corkboard. But he would immediately drop it out of his mouth and grab another one. My guess is the cat actually did pull the tack out of the board, and then OP decided to make it look like he then put it in his shoe.

You hobble over to the lights and find lengths of mouse intestine stuck to your foot (and kidneys between your toes,) have to clean your foot, still have to pee, then have to clean up the remains of the mouse, all the while wanting nothing more than to go back to sleep.

c8cy1hc	31	3	I was told this a kid too but just so everyone knows, carrots giving you better eyesight **is a myth**.   During WWII the RAF was having great success against the German Luftwaffe, especially at night. The actual reason for this was the recent advancement in RADAR technology and in order to keep this fact a secret, England routinely stated an increase in carrot rationing was the cause.   A secondary benefit from this ruse was the introduction of carrots into the staple diet of British civilians. The UK has excellent growing conditions for root vegetables but prior to WWII carrots were seldom seen on British tables. With constant blackouts and power losses civilians welcomed the possibility to improve visibility in the pitch black nights.
c8d02h8	5	1	Looks like this guy checks out.  Fucking British are real cheeky bastards, TIL never trust a Brit.
c8cza0c	9	4	Well in fairness, Vitamin A deficiency can cause a loss of eyesight, and since carrots are rich in Vitamin A, there is some truth to the saying.

c8d0b9o	4	0	Increases eyesight of those who have a Vitamin A deficiency
c8d0fk6	3	0	You're absolutely right that eating carrots won't help people who don't have Vitamin A deficiency, but for those people who do have vision symptoms due to Vitamin A deficiency, eating carrots will help them regain their vision.  This won't happen much in the developed world because of the rarity of Vitamin A deficiency there, but for some parts of the world where Vitamin A deficiency is common, eating carrorts can improve vision.

Although there is a correlation between age and what technology you can recognize, the biggest factor into what technology you recognize is what you are exposed to. Ignorance is also a factor.

c8cvmdf	15	1	which is incredibly stupid
c8cvugi	8	0	Not really.  Many songs average around four minutes and sources like iTunes have a standard bit rate so it's easy to know how the minute/byte ratio.  Granted it's not useful if a person likes their music at a higher bit rate but they are not the target of that information.

c8cu86i	52	5	It's funny how lots of tests of how well developed a child is is based on such cards and if the child recognizes what's in the picture or not. Some times these test results get twisted results because the word the test is looking for is outdated, like "Steam engine" instead of "train" or stuff like this, where the object simply is outdated.   At the kindergarten i used to work at, lots of tests like these caused some headache because they made perfectly normal children seem to have problems, when it in fact were the tests that were poorly made
c8cva0k	20	3	i can understand this. I moved to the states when i was 10 from England. I guess we hadn't learned division yet so i had no idea what we were doing. That hurt my confidence in math for a good while.  More importantly though was spelling. There are so many words that are spelled differently it's ridiculous. Even ones that don't come up very often but when i get it wrong i felt dumb.  It was a pain.
c8cvfjt	17	0	Colour, neighbour, centre, cheque.
c8cxjd4	4	1	How else would you write cheque?
c8cxylf	3	0	"Check"
c8d08g9	2	0	Your teacher should have counted those right because of the different spelling between the countries. Did she not realize that you spell things differently or did she think you were the dumb one?
c8cw8eh	11	1	My little brother had some of these when he was little and the caption on the card with a picture of a hot dog was "frankfurter."
c8cx34l	5	0	its even more complicated now because your concept of what a phone looks like could also have to do with your economic status!
c8cy50l	1	1	you should know more than one definition.  in fact, I think this is a good thing to test for.
c8czi5k	1	0	The tester lady at our son's school got very concerned my son didn't know what a watch was. I then told her he hadn't seen a watch in our household since he was born because mom and dad eschewed watched for cellphones. She was still 'concerned.'
c8cu9w1	39	5	My kids don't really *really* know the difference between a tv and a computer, either. 
c8cvboh	22	2	well as my monitor is actually a TV and I use it for both things... It could be a very easy thing to confuse.  Also I had to explain to my cousin that my gps in my car couldn't play TV shows. 
c8cwu7u	4	0	WHY NOT???!!
c8cx3rn	4	0	He asked so many questions like that, by the time I was done explaining to him why my GPS couldn't, he had learned about VHS and "not flat screen" TVs.  I don't like telling kids "because I said so" or dumb answers like that. It doesn't actually explain anything. 
c8cv96q	8	1	You can plug a computer into most flat screen TVs. You can watch TV shows on a computer. There's almost no difference already.
c8cvpt9	5	1	honestly, a tv and computer are nothing alike.  A tv is a monitor.
c8cwqji	8	1	No it isn't. I would say that the part that makes a tv a tv is the receiver.
c8cupbi	9	4	And there is increasingly little difference between the two, so they really won't need to know the difference for much longer anyway.
c8cx3l6	2	0	high end TVs have dual-core processors in them now so you could say that's intentional
c8cumg8	45	9	My daughter insists that this is a calculator.
c8cux0a	24	2	cant be. calculator numbers have 1 in the lower left, not upper left. 
c8cv836	70	5	Also because calculators are not telephones.
c8cvah1	25	3	Although some phones are also calculators.
c8cvmn1	16	3	I have a droid calculator that has a telephone app.
c8d0mrn	1	0	I laughed at that more than I should have.
c8cxqwn	2	0	I told her this and she just looked at me like I'm an idiot.
c8cu3t6	79	11	2yo - "Hmmmm...it looks like an archaic instrument of some sort...perhaps you use it for cleaning?  Clearly the top part is connected to the bottom part, and there must be some purpose for that.  I'm gonna go with vaccuum."
c8cv9hx	19	3	Yes... let's just see here... those buttons must exist to input how many rooms it will begin self-cleaning..
c8cvicv	12	1	buttons? Is that what you call the num-pad on the touch screen?
c8cv0k0	28	2	I'm a therapist and I administer IQ tests. One item asks why we put stamps on letters. Kids never get that one... I don't understand why that question is still in the tests, but it's funny to hear some of the answers the kids come up with.
c8cw893	8	0	I must know their reasons! 
c8cwe2k	15	0	Some I can remember off the top of my head: - To make sure thats it's a legitimate letter (as in not fake, counterfeit).  - To decorate the letter, make it pretty. - To make sure the letter gets to the proper address. - To seal the letter (or envelope). - So the recipient gets a sticker. It's really cute when these answers come from little kids.  
c8cwica	9	0	I really like the sticker reason. No stickers on email!
c8cwehm	6	0	There are a staggering number of young adults (18-20) on here that have no idea how to mail a letter.  Thinking back from my own experience, the last time I wrote a letter for social communication was about 1996.
c8cxzps	1	0	Is "we don't" a valid answer?
c8ct4mb	28	2	We have a little play phone that looks just like that. He knows that it is a phone, and that our smartphones are phones. Also, a small VPN device is apparently a phone in his mind.   Kids are weird.
c8cunq6	22	1	When I was a kid, I thought a banana was a phone.
c8cus9v	18	0	Is that not normal? It was also a gun.
c8cuzp1	5	0	[And now I really want to create an account named Relevant Raffi.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzsARKdO9EU)
c8cwjgl	2	0	My kids kept trying to talk into my GPS.
c8cx5us	1	0	That was mostly Raffi's fault, though.
c8cuj13	13	0	what's a vpn device?   edit: found out for myself, it's a bit like a router but for managing a vpn. I didn't bother googling it because I assumed I'd get hundreds of 'how do I set up vpn on my device' posts
c8cur44	7	0	Dongle
c8cusk1	4	0	like one of those rsa keyfobs??
c8cv4z5	2	0	Things are weird. Your VPN device uses at least some of the same protocols your smartphone uses. It *is* a kind of phone. You can't make calls with it, but then again, you probably can't make calls with his play phone either.
c8cqkpo	149	26	The weird thing is that phones develop so quickly that if you print a whole new generation of cards, they'll be obsolete quickly, too.  There were phones that look like that(hotel-type phones), then there were the ones that look literally about the size of a brick with a curved top, then there were the little Nokia phones, then flip phones, then soap-bar sized phones, et cetera. Within a few years, I wonder if the concept of phones will even continue to exist, or if enabling us to talk to people who aren't physically near you will just be thought of as another thing that our wireless computers do. I really think that phone numbers will be going away soon.
c8cswao	168	20	"hotel-type phones"  Home phones looked like that once too.
c8ctu2j	113	8	I think the point is hotel phones still look like that.
c8cvocy	7	0	And they're the only phones that still look like that. That and office phones.
c8cw6dz	7	1	What office do you work in that has phones like that?
c8ctak7	50	9	Eh, the business world still uses desk-style phones. I don't see that going away anytime soon. 
c8cte98	43	0	The company I work for has completely got rid of all desk phones.  You have the following options available to you  * Install a VoIP app on your mobile phone  * Install a VoIP app on your computer  Most people prefer the app on their computer with a headset, I prefer to use CSipSimple on my personal mobile as I regard my company Blackberry as a pointless piece of shit masquerading as a phone.
c8ctj7h	23	2	The thing is land-lines are seen as more "secure" by most companies. Therefore most haven't switched. 
c8cu21n	32	3	Well, I've seen internet go down far more regularly then I've seen phone lines go down.
c8cua01	22	2	Reliability and security are not the same thing. But in this case phone lines are both more reliable and more secure. In fact, I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make.
c8cuyh2	6	0	I believe sideburns was agreeing with pjgamer while adding the aspect of reliability, not just security that phone lines give.
c8cv04y	5	0	We still have a hard phone line in my house, every time a hurricane or tropical storm makes its way up to us it's always the only thing that still works.
c8cw4bx	3	0	I think it's more than that. Sometimes you want to talk to someone who's in a specific place, but don't really care who you you talk to there. You're never going to order pizza by calling the pizzeria owner's cell and sometimes at work, I need to talk to whomever's at the front desk or the loading dock. You could probably dream up some magic system that detects where people are and forwards the calls appropriately, but honestly, it's far cheaper and easier to spring for a land-line.
c8cu4jq	7	0	I await having parts installed in my pinky and thumb so that when I make the "call me" sign, I can actually pick up.
c8cuo4n	4	0	Then all the expressive talkers with have an equivalent to pocket dialing.
c8cvtw5	4	0	[You might have to go go gadget for that...](http://damncoolgadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/inspector-gadget-the-original-series-20060223115551141_640w.jpg)
c8cu2s1	11	2	My prediction: Phone capabilities will shift to Google Glasses-esque products, and all other features of a smartphone will go to Tablets like the iPads which will be more popular and widely used (Tablets, not iPads).  ^I'll ^save ^this ^comment ^to ^laugh ^at ^myself ^in ^30 ^years.
c8cr2qh	10	9	They already do that. They're called smart phones.
c8ctrii	20	2	Yes, but we still call them smart**phones**. That's what he was getting at. Maybe in the (near) future we'll stop thinking of them as smart**phones** and instead as mobile computers, and one of their many, many features is allowing you to talk with someone at a distance.  Yes, this is already how they function, but our paradigm of "phones" has not shifted yet to catch up with the functionality.
c8cvton	3	0	The old terminology might just stick around. We still "dial" phone numbers even though touch-tone phones have been dominant for decades.
c8cx405	1	0	English is not my first language. I use dial without any notion that it corresponds to a specific physical action.
c8cuvm6	12	0	My daughter had to get glasses when she was 2 1/2.  And although she knew her alphabet, they had a picture chart to test eyesight.  they were block outlines and the Telephone was like that but on the hook, she was really confused... "uh... a t-shirt?" she said.
c8curig	16	2	History is a tough subject for a lot of people.
c8cu7q8	6	0	I still have a phone that is like that only a rotary dial model. Still has a property of Bell sticker on it from back when you had to rent phones. Not mine it's my parents but whenever my friends come over they all think it's pretty cool.
c8cv95r	9	0	Are you sure they aren't still renting it?... My parents discovered they'd paid nearly $1500 in monthly fees for renting a rotary phone that they'd forgotten about.
c8cuhcx	3	0	My parents used to have a phone like that, it was all plastic and yellowed and had a rotary dial on the front.  They kept it in their bedroom until the end of the 90s, when we got a new pair of cordless phones for upstairs and downstairs when our old downstairs phone(that one was cordless, but big and heavy, and the dialpad was still on the cradle) broke.  I never checked to see if it had any weird stickers, and I'm pretty sure they tossed it out sometime in the last 15 years.
c8cuj49	6	0	When I was little, the doctor was testing my vocabulary to make sure my constant ear infections weren't messing with my hearing and language acquisition, and that deck had a rotary phone. I called it a "fashion phone" meaning "old-fashioned phone." I had no problem with language acquisition. 
c8cus6x	6	0	This is great. I worked with little kids for awhile. We had a matching game and one tile was a phone like that. Most kids said "iron" or "i have no idea".
c8cva15	38	9	http://i.imgur.com/Smvdswm.png
c8cvlb9	16	2	When I was about 3, I went to preschool &amp; we were shown cards like that... I had an English accent, &amp; was in America. It was a ball, &amp; I said it was a ball &amp; the lady said, "no, that's not a bull, a bull has horns": it was *so* patronising &amp; offensive, I never got over it. I hated the stupidity of that woman... I had Branston pickle (a lovely, savory English spread of pickled vegetables) on my sandwich, she asked what it was, I said it was pickle &amp; she, once again, said, "no, that's not pickle, pickles are green." ---it made a bad impression of America for me... just thought I'd share that.
c8cwygs	6	1	She was indeed a retard; pickle is a verb which is informally used as nickname for foods which have been pickled.
c8cufw2	10	1	My two year old nephew has already sussed the swipe to unlock on my iPhone. So I guess he would fail this test too.

c8cvt16	4	0	I feel like we are turning into "that" generation. Like how we are with people now who lived before widespread usage of car/electricity and plumbing. 
c8cw7ls	7	1	My son tried to swipe the screen on the cordless house phone to answer it.  I feel you. 
c8cufec	3	0	We have one of those but even more old school. It's a rotary dial one. When I was a kid my friend came over and tried to use it by pushing the little holes where you dial. 
c8cw5sz	3	0	Phew, my 5 year old still got it. Though he did get very confused yesterday about how to hang up his great aunt's cord phone. 
c8cw8zz	3	0	I was helping a nine-year-old with a puzzle where the answer was CD/Compact Disc.   She had no idea what a CD was, even after I explained it to her.
c8cxfjt	2	1	My 11 year old niece asked us today, "Hey mom, what is a floppy disk?" :|
c8cuh6y	7	2	I stared at it for a few seconds because I couldn't get it.   For other old farts: it's because the newer generations don't have non-wireless home phones.
c8cvcam	8	0	And some don't have home phones at all. 
c8cu6dc	16	15	Didn't get it at first... then realized the 2yo has probably never seen a phone of that style. I feel old.
c8cuxh7	28	6	You arent.

c8cvmma	2	0	It took me a while to get this. I'm like, "What? It's a telephone." And then I was like, "Ohhhhh". I just realized that people growing up now won't know what the hell that thing is. This is the first time in my life i've felt old.

c8cxnvg	1	0	OP, what company makes these flash cards? Curious, as I work for a large educational publishing company and if it's ours, I'd like to fix it for future reprints. We just finished a recent project where an image like that was implemented for 'phone,' and I was the only one who noticed that the art used wouldn't make sense to most kids. Sounds surprising, but when you stop to think that the people creating the products grew up with phones like that, it makes a little more sense that it would be overlooked.

c8cxszc	3	0	Seriously. I spend WAY too much time on reddit, but 90% of the time when I see people bitching about a repost, it's something I've never seen before.  I mean, I spend my whole workday here, almost every day. How much time are these people spending on reddit?
c8cvvbp	3	3	Nah.
c8cx7cx	1	0	But then they might miss a post, and when it's reposted it'll be new to them.
c8cv9z5	12	16	I saw this one by chance on Yahoo! News about a year ago, while I was casually looking around at their bullshit stories, not looking for anything like this. I feel like once something of this nature reaches Yahoo!, it's done.   Might as well repost it again to /r/forwardsfromgrandma.

c8cui4i	7	2	I tried.
c8cuo6y	39	25	You have to realize that reddit content is like a book. Only the first printing is any good because it contains the spirit of original content.  Edit: /s because apparently some redditors have never read books.
c8cuvdk	14	20	Reddit is not at all like a book.  If it were like a book, it would have a plot. It would have an exposition, a rising action, a climax, a falling action, and a denouement. The story would be, while unknown to the reader if being read for the first time, set in stone. Readers would read the same things as others, always see the exact same things as everyone else.  Reddit is not like that at all. Reddit has no plot. There's no linear plot to this site. Its readers don't see everything that other people do because they're not always here and Reddit just keeps moving along on its erratic path of probability, giving them no time to see everything.  Not everyone is going to see the same things you do, and even if they do a lot of them aren't going to even care. Just because you've seen something before doesn't mean everyone has, doesn't mean everyone is tired of it. If it's got upvotes, it means that there are people who haven't seen it or still think it's worth seeing.
c8cuwwa	16	0	Not all books have plot. 
c8cv28a	19	1	yeah, the dictionary's plot was terrible, and it used way too many words I didn't know, I could usually work them out from the context though

c8csxj6	30	4	the problem here is that you dont have eyes.
c8cte3a	19	4	How dare you.....
c8cslq6	36	16	I know this GIF. I've been Redditing too much. I'm going outside.
c8csr15	39	5	It's cold and there are people outside, you're sure?
c8cuhnj	10	2	Outside?
c8cuvac	3	0	Beside.
c8cwwbj	1	0	My computer. 
c8cuuai	4	3	[](/flutterwhoa)What is this... outside? 
c8cuway	10	1	I think you need to be level 5 to unlock Outside.
c8cv0u0	2	0	[](/fluttershh) Ohhhhh. Thanks.
c8cvla3	1	0	[](/2b) Outside is great!
c8ctvvc	4	2	We require proof!
c8cu9ge	10	3	What is this "outside" I keep hearing about?
c8cuan4	16	4	/r/outside 
c8cunyp	18	3	The graphics are amazing but it's [kind of buggy](http://dailypicksandflicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/forks-balancing-on-a-coin-on-a-glass-cup.jpg).
c8cuqyy	7	2	It's not a bug, it's a feature.
c8cv0eb	2	0	Well count me in, as long as they have pvp.
c8cvcsp	2	0	Careful, it's free to play, but I've heard they have cash shops for everything.  Definitely pay to win, unfortunately.
c8cvk1c	2	0	Respawning also takes *forever*
c8cv10h	2	1	The forks are touching an ass-penny and the photographer is surely about to eat with them.
c8cum8m	1	0	DONT DO IT! ITS DANGEROUS OUT THERE!
c8cuy3v	2	0	I've been there.  It's not that great.  Not enough cats.
c8cuzdf	1	0	You're full of lies. I see you commenting in other threads.
c8cvzn5	1	0	D: How do you know my language?!?!?!!!
c8cwk79	1	1	you know this cuz its posted every 3-5 days by karma whoring faggot niggers
c8cubqc	7	4	Gets posted daily
c8cun2o	5	1	I've been on reddit for almost a year without seeing it, guess I'm lucky that I could laugh at it this time then
c8cudv6	149	77	[Boo](http://d22zlbw5ff7yk5.cloudfront.net/images/stash-1-50e9c94242be8.gif)
c8cuung	59	11	Cool gif.  Except is it really a big deal if it's a repost?  It's the first time I've, and apparently at least 1800+ others have seen it.  Are you seriously expecting *only* original content on reddit *every* day?
c8cv1id	21	1	I *think* that the gif is pretty sarcastic in its exaggeration 
c8cv467	7	0	Well, I think that the point of the giff is that, yes, it lets us know that it is a repost, but look at who is saying it. So is a big deal to the old crazy lady that lives in Reddit, as she has seen it already lots of times and is tired of it, but not for everyone else. 
c8cut1o	9	1	Aaaaaand now I'm going to go watch The Princess Bride.
c8cut91	4	0	[BOOOOOOOO, JFKgotnoscoped, BOOOOO.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de3WWGCK4N0)
c8cv2zl	2	0	Yeah, repost that .gif that you found a while back, that'll show that reposter!
c8cuqge	3	0	[And then there's this cat.  Who is just a dick that knocks stuff over for no reason.](http://i.imgur.com/p8v9y.gif)
c8cuvsc	5	0	I'm pretty sure you just described every cat ever.
c8cvmjh	3	0	Using a green laser as a cat toy is highly not recommended. Green lasers are much more likely to cause eye damage.
c8cwu34	1	0	I would upvote but it is at 2112 and I am not breaking that! =)
c8cu3i2	15	9	......BOOP......
c8cv4dj	5	6	[Target Locked](http://i.imgur.com/UxRTd.gif)

c8cuh7d	4	1	[Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFztjgfDWDA&amp;feature=player_embedded) if anyone is interested.
c8cuqtn	4	1	Well, but, technically, it's not a repost, it's just a well known gif used as a "[fixed]" answer to another post.  Don't see not problem here.
c8cwldj	1	1	oh ok well then lets discuss the rules with [fixed] posts   
c8cv1xj	3	3	OP: "/r/funny liked this, so I'm sure that /r/funny will LOVE this!"
c8cukf8	7	3	Seriously guys we get it, this gif has been posted before. This is a different context though, hence the [FIXED] part. I don't think that should count as a repost 
c8cv3or	5	4	http://i.minus.com/iqQcC3wzWEx7g.gif
c8cuwoq	8	5	holy shit dude(s) shut the fuck up about reposts.  This is a site that millions use every day. Not everybody stays on for 24 hours 7 days a week and sees every single post.
c8cwktj	3	4	holy shit dude its on reddit every 3-5 days so go eat a nigger shit 
c8cu36g	16	17	Wow, it's just super duper to see this gif get reposted once again. It has been many hours since my last view of it. This image has been been burned so deeply into my memory that I finally see the beautiful, symbolic message within.   It is a visual metaphor: the laser is the illusion of choice, the cat represents consciousness, and the subsequent collision with the solo cups represent unforeseen destiny. Although one may believe he is in control of his future, impulsive desires can overtake logical thought and produce negative results within one's life.  Reposting has revealed to me one of life's most beautiful lessons and has brought purpose into my life. We should all take time to repost each day so that we may begin to collectively unravel the secrets of existence.
c8cu62g	6	1	That... That was actually beautiful.

c8cunul	2	0	I can see this become a thing in my house...
c8cunwh	2	0	This is old, but still funny. I think the originator must have watch some Bugs Bunny cartoons at one time. 
c8cuo20	1	0	I have to do this.
c8cuot5	1	0	Gives new definition to laserlight bowling
c8cuqaa	1	0	That is fucking amazing, im going to try it,,, unfortunately i have a feeling it wont work with my dog :(
c8cur8t	2	0	Don't worry, you're not in the gang until they beat the shit out of you.
c8cure2	3	0	Now all someone has to do is use a laser pointer on a tiger, lion or some other huge ass cat... and get it on video...
c8cuy06	2	0	Haha... now if someone could use a laser pointer to go bowling with a tiger into a bunch of zebras... now that would be something amazing....

c8cvjlv	1	0	Well planned. Now I want to get a cat or visit one of my buddies that have one to reenact this wonderful ballad.
c8cvk2l	2	0	Has anyone ever tried this but with a crate at the end, so that you can take your cat to the vet? It takes three people to get my 25+ lb Maine coon into a carrier, and it's one of the most terrifying experiences of your life.   If I could avoid this sort-of throw-down in the future (and hearing his evil death cries), it would be a miracle.
c8cvlae	1	0	I want a cat.
c8cvn4r	2	0	Dont use lasers on cats!

c8cvtaf	1	1	Guys, don't do that with your dogs. It can fuck up their brains.
c8cvuyw	1	0	I did this yo mu dog once. He was hooked for the first 5 minutes and then became too smart and he just stared at me
c8cvw1e	1	0	I've been watching this far longer than is healthy... meh *switches tabs back to the gif*
c8cvwhz	2	0	Had to sort through a fuckton of comments before getting to one actually relevant to the gif, and not just complaining about reposts.  I swear, reddit bitches about reposts more than there's actual content.

c8cugs4	4	1	you missed the opportunity to stack the cups in an up arrow formation.
c8cuot3	2	3	A repost to number one front page? Come on Reddit!
c8cv0i0	3	1	Right, because everyone on Reddit has seen this before?

c8cudfd	6	10	This fucking GIF couldn't be reposted any harder if every single person on Reddit tried to submit it at once.

c8cuiya	3	1	My cat can't seem to get excited by anything. Laser pointers, catnip - nothing seems to do the trick.  That was until we tried Confuse-A-Cat. Now he's much better! A local news station even did a bit on it.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Je1CEPkUM

c8cvoa9	26	4	I will RES tag you "Dangerous ex-gf finder"
c8cvssr	35	9	I have him tagged as 'fucked a pancake' and I'm trying to remember why.

c8cwdp0	15	3	I fucked that old lady. Remember now?
c8cwk0p	4	0	Yes. Now I have to go back and read that.
c8cy40x	3	0	well that escalated quickly
c8cwvdo	12	0	You can get 4 points for that??
c8cvm1h	8	3	What street did you do the u-turn? 
c8cvmg8	31	8	On Arapahoe at the Taco Bell by the entrance to 25.
c8cvrxm	21	5	Ah yeah that is a complicated intersection. I don't like that area.
c8cwcha	19	1	The Shane Company.  Just off Arapahoe Road at Emporia St, one half mile east of I-25.
c8cwdd5	4	0	4 points for a u-turn goddamn, I wounder what it is in PA because there is one place I do a u-turn which is illegal but more safe than pulling off and trying to turn around and more convenient than driving 2 miles out of my way for the opportunity to safely turn around.  Seriously u-turn involving 2 lanes of traffic or pulling into a parking lot then legally crossing 3 lanes, I take the U turn.
c8cuv6p	13	0	I read it as "failed to observe (or) disregard a traffic control signal."   I am sorry officer, I failed to disregard the signal! I'll be sure to disregard it next time. 
c8ctnjp	87	14	Holy crap I think I drove by you as this was happening!
c8ctptd	54	10	Hahaha like 10:45? White jeep?
c8ctsi7	63	9	Time is right, but I only paid mind to the flashing lights.
c8cwuhb	17	5	We now live in a world where it is more unlikely that tech-savvy strangers meet and don't use reddit. 
c8ct5f9	79	6	Well there goes the rumor that once they start writing a ticket they cant stop.
c8ctn6l	41	7	Every voided ticket is supposed to be reported to the courts so they can legally remove the ticket from their records. He most likely just took the copy and sent the request in. It's not that they can't stop writing it, they just have to report it to void it.
c8cwvyl	5	0	If I void a ticket, it can only be voided if I had in all copies and give a reason why I voided it which is seen by my supervisor and the municipal prosecutor.  If I dismiss a ticket, I can hand in all the copies except the one given to the violator, but I still have to give a valid reason why I dismissed it.  I'd like to see the reason the officer gave.
c8ctf86	15	2	It's only if the ticket is written electronically...
c8ctn34	33	5	Not necessarily. Officers' ticket books have serial numbers and missing tickets can raise questions. 
c8cvlrz	23	3	Yeah, I wouldn't post this online. The officer may get in trouble depending on what his department policy is on voiding tickets. 
c8cqg64	152	16	Centennial, lone tree, Denver, and aurora cops are pretty nice   If you got this ticket in Parker he would have laughed all the way to the door panels of your car as he ripped apart your car looking for drugs
c8cqicz	56	8	Haven't been to Parker yet...anything worth going over there for?
c8cuhn7	67	2	Aside from the heroine dealers, no

c8cvln5	20	1	Ah, I read your ".....again?" as "man, how many times do I have to post this?" Reading the image text before the link text brings it all together, though.

c8cvnzi	4	0	Represent!  Additional Centenniallianan here.
c8cszci	38	4	How is it a 4 point ticket but only a 100 bucks.  I've had 1 point tickets that are like 250 in fines.  Maybe it's a court cost thing but all of these fines look a lot lower then the ones I've seen in other states.
c8ct13v	30	6	Idk, I just moved here but Colorado seems pretty cool with the fines. Even parking tickets are half of that in Long Island, NY or NJ where I'm from.
c8ct3ov	14	1	I'm mostly jealous, gotten speeding tickets in 4 states (Ohio, Virginia, Tennessee, West Virginia) all for going less then 10 over and all were between 180 - 250 dollars.
c8cuvsk	29	1	I got a ticket for going 9 over in Wyoming of all places... It was only 85 dollars, and got a 10 dollar discount for wearing a seat belt lol.
c8cvi68	7	2	&gt;10 dollar discount for wearing a seat belt  damn, I spilled my tea all over my keyboard.
c8cv57e	12	1	20 over in Montana is $20/$25. 
c8curs7	36	2	Can't see Arapahoe Road without thinking "Now you have a friend in the diamond business: the Shane Company. Just off Arapahoe Road on Emporia Street, a half a mile east of I-25. Open every night Monday through Friday til 8. Saturday and Sunday til 5."
c8cvmk2	8	2	Online at shaneco.com.
c8ctn1w	9	1	I thought "once we start writing the ticket we can't stop" blah blah blah
c8cvjt7	5	0	I think that's only for meter maids since they use a handheld device.
c8cx56n	4	0	Or it is just used as an excuse because they want to pretend like they have sympathy and move on.
c8cuetg	8	0	what does 4 points mean?
c8cuhwm	16	3	In the US, moving violations give you "points." Depending on the state, you lose your license after a certain number of points. I currently have 5, and would have lost my license for having 9. This cop is my hero.
c8cusib	7	0	I thought our point limit in CO was 12 per rolling year?
c8cut5s	5	1	NJ license, my friend.
c8cvenc	6	1	It's definitely 12 points in NJ as well.  Here's the [NJ Motor Vehicle Comission](http://www.state.nj.us/mvc/Violations/penalties.htm)  If you haven't done it, go sit through a defensive driving course if one is available. Might be a problem if you're now living out of state, but they're pitifully easy to pass and they'll cut a few hundred dollars a year off your insurance for the cost of a couple hours one evening.
c8cvgfk	5	1	I'm corrected. The fines come in after 7 or 9 though. 250 a year for 3 years.
c8cy0i1	3	0	I live in Oregon and have never heard of this point system....

c8cv44m	3	1	Happy birthday!
c8ctg7d	4	0	You should celebrate your birthday with a Pancake.
c8ctkey	4	0	I got a ticket on my 19th birthday for going around a traffic circle a couple times. I got a 90 fine and had to do a breathalyzer because they saw an empty beer can in the bed of the truck.
c8cvhc4	5	0	The same thing happened to me, it's outlandish I know. Mine was pretty much the same deal except it was about a dozen empty cans in my floorboard instead.
c8cu8u6	4	0	That's just down the street from my office.  This is my closest brush with Reddit front page fame.
c8cw146	4	0	damn, a 4 points in cali woulda cost u $1000 or something

c8cto1t	5	2	I heard/saw. Shit looked crazy, hope you and your family are safe.
c8cucaw	6	1	driving on the wrong side of a highway is only a $100 fine?! 
c8cv3i7	3	2	He made an illegal U-turn. 
c8cvgnc	4	0	I'm looking at the other charges that can be ticked off on the ticket. 
c8cvqq5	7	3	How did you get this March 19th 2013?
c8cxki5	9	4	You people are dumb. Read the fucking paper. It's the court date, and it's been asked 50 times in here.
c8cuhju	3	0	According to that sheet of paper, if i lived where you do, i would be like thousands of dollars richer right now.

c8cvxp6	3	0	not funny 
c8ctbv4	3	2	I got pulled over on my birthday, literally a block from my house, and I thought maybe the cop would realize this and maybe let me off the hook... NOPE.
c8cuyeb	10	8	That's awesome, but it demonstrates that we're at the mercy of the law enforcer, not the law.
c8cvg41	11	1	We live in a civilization populated by human beings, not computer code.
c8csurl	12	8	Damn, you're lucky! I got pulled over for no seat-belt on my birthday once, cop gave me the ticket as well as a sarcastic "Happy Birthday".
c8cv16f	37	4	Click it or ticket, motherfucker. Wear your goddamn seatbelt.  
c8cst0k	2	2	Might be a good idea to block out the address next time.  Edit. I'm dumb and didn't realize somebody said this. Please ignore me.
c8cstyn	4	2	Why would that be necessary?
c8cswd1	1	1	Even though its not your address its just a good idea to keep all information possible off the Internet. Creepers can be crazy man. 
c8csxy8	5	2	If it was anywhere near my home, I would have blocked it out. It's just a main street in Centennial though.
c8cvopp	15	2	OP HAS BEEN NEAR SOUTHGLEN EVERYONE!
c8crjy7	12	12	The only ticket I've ever gotten was on my birthday. It was $189 and the jerk didn't even say happy birthday. Five minutes down the road, a bicyclist was hit by a guy driving a Mustang on a suspended license and no authorities or ambulance got there for a half hour. I guess the cop had something better to do. The bicyclist died :(
c8culzz	2	0	I got a speeding ticket on my birthday this year. $174.50 for going 7 over. Couldn't dispute because I was two states over on court date. :(  Thanks, buddy.
c8cun54	2	0	You lucky bastard. My first ticket ever was the night of my 17th birthday for going 8mph over the limit when the limit was changing in less than a block. That cop gave zero fucks.
c8cupuo	2	1	The fact that that and driving on the wrong side of the highway have the same fine confuses me. 
c8cuq0v	1	0	lucky, I got a ticket on my birthday and the cop was a total wanker about it.
c8cus2v	2	0	I've always felt centennial/aurora cops are pretty nice for the most part.
c8cuwkz	2	0	I really like their ticket formatting. In Va, it doesn't give you any freaking info on the paperwork. To get the fine amount you have to call the court and to get the demerit points you either ask the court or the DMV.    Edit: apparently they generally give a piece of paper with the fine amount reference to it, but unfortunately with the tickets I've received in the past I havent always received that paper.
c8cuwq7	2	0	I actually live 2 minutes north of there... Was it that light at Arapahoe and Yosemite that has the camera?
c8cuyx3	2	0	We share a birthday. yay
c8cuzid	2	0	you must have a different point system there.  i nearly had a spit take when i saw 4 points that that instant 12 month suspended lic here.   
c8cv1s7	1	0	I got a ticket on my birthday too bad it was a parking ticket so he couldn't see that it was my birthday
c8cv38d	1	0	I've had bad luck with Arapahoe County cops, but no issue with Centennial cops. 
c8cv3q8	1	0	And cops always say there's nothing they can do once they start writing the ticket
c8cv495	1	0	We have the same birthday!! Happy Birthday!! :)
c8cv5kh	2	0	I now have the information I need to bring your reign of tyranny down.
c8cv8jm	2	0	I got a 6 point, $190 dollar ticket on the night of my birthday...  The cop was being extra snarky about it. New York City cops.
c8cva61	1	0	There are good ones out there.  It's good to hear these stories.
c8cvb26	2	0	"I've already started the ticket, sorry."  "You could just void it"  TIL
c8cvcr3	1	0	Think he meant February haha
c8cvd3d	2	0	Centennial cops are pretty nice. You're lucky that you didn't pulled over in Greenwood Village.
c8cveci	1	1	It's cool they can do whatever the fuck they want, just like that, right?  e: Lemme guess, OP is white?
c8cverg	1	0	Actually this happened to me too. I was driving and blew several stop signs. Police officer stops me and I tell him I'm rushing home for my birthday and he let me go after double checking... Was soo happy. Best present ever. lol 
c8cvf83	1	1	Now we all know where you live!
c8cvgg3	1	1	Can someone care to explain this "VOID" to those who live far far away and don't get it? ;)
c8cvgm6	1	0	never stopped centennial, or denver cops from giving me tickets on my birthday. hah sometimes there are nice ones out there. might be cause i'm a felon haha
c8cvgvo	1	0	Has anyone ever gotten a ticket for 5MPH over the limit?
c8cvgzi	2	0	Well that's no good, it only encourages the same behavior later in life.
c8cvhqb	1	0	what violation is 4 points and only a $100??
c8cvhqy	1	0	Man, oh man! You have to love Colorado!  Good on you for redacting some of that image; don't want the friendly policeman / policewoman to get in trouble for the awesomeness. Well done, fellow Coloradan!
c8cvhu3	1	0	So... you are officially "allowed" to go 4 mph over the speed limit?
c8cvhzm	2	0	This entire thread is made up of people that know you it saw you.  Weird.  Grats on being sober.  Happy birthday!
c8cvist	2	0	lol, would never happen in sweden.  Was it a speeding ticket? Here in sweden they start out at about 350 dollars and the next level is about 600 dollars.
c8cvixd	1	0	What is this "point" system? 
c8cvjri	2	0	I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY
c8cvjxf	1	0	Got pulled for doing 11 mph over the speed limit two days before my 17^th birthday about two months ago. It was my first time getting pulled over and he let me go.
c8cyyeq	16	3	Stupid cop can't even read
c8cwf52	32	6	For anyone that doesn't get it: The man being arrested is wearing a t-shirt that says, "Don't arrest this man." He is being arrested. The irony is he is being arrested with the shirt on.  I hope I cleared that up for some people.

c8ctfr3	71	16	get those goats some coats
c8cupti	37	2	I always thought we should make them leather biker vests. Goats are badasses and deserve fitting attire!...the only problem is that they would eat them. I once saw a goat eating a Pepsi can! Did I stop it? Nope, that bastard would have rammed me if I did :P
c8cvprj	10	1	If you presented it with a tastier option, would it have abandoned the can?  I have never been around goats before.  
c8cwnnh	10	2	They're pretty adamant about eating anything...probably would have finished the can regardless.
c8cxnc9	3	0	I suspected as much.  Oh well.  Hope he (she?) enjoyed the can then.
c8cxrfs	4	0	Je'd probably hold on to the can while he investigated the tastier option, if he approved, he would abandon the can, eaten the tastier thing, and then returned to the can.
c8d0by5	2	0	I imagine that it would finish the can and then move on to just about ANYthing else :P  They have literally chewed their was THROUGH a barn wall. Through sheet-rock, wood, insulation and god knows what else! Exciting times were had by all!
c8d0dic	3	0	...would a goat attempt to eat another goat, if sufficiently bored?  
c8d0hhz	2	0	http://i.imgur.com/GeH5k.gif  I actually coughed I laughed so hard! "if sufficiently bored" totally made me think of all types of hilarity...including somehow relating a "sufficiently bored" goat to Jabba the Hut! Silly me!
c8d0juv	2	0	I've seen pictures of goats standing on other goats because... well.... goats &lt;shrug&gt;.  If they eat anything at all, I wonder how long it would take before a bored goat tried something animate.      Suddenly I'm visualizing a goat trying to eat a chicken.  For some reason this strikes me as rather funny.  
c8cv90v	9	0	ya don't trust anything near that fuckers mouth.
c8cto8v	25	2	I'm currently bottle feeding a new born lamb because of that damn storm. He was born on friday and was pushed up against the wall of  the shelter and his leg got caught on a board so he was dangling by his leg and his mother abandoned him. I had to get him under a heat lamp and feed him formula.  
c8cu89q	26	2	We had a mama reject one of her babies. So I would just pin her to the wall (non violently) and let the baby nurse every few hours. It was a long few weeks.   Edit. I just dug up photos of the baby goat. Sorry for the quality this was a long time ago.   [Album](http://imgur.com/a/yCzO5)
c8cv0w8	24	2	Ahaha forcible nursing, ewe monster!
c8cvkgm	23	0	haha! It was really sad though. This mama goat was always a little 'off' in the head. And when she had her first baby she just walked away from him. There was just this tiny ball of fluff all by itself in the middle of the barn. And every time it tried to nurse the mama would just go crazy and head butt the baby and throw it in the air. The baby would just scream and chase the mama around trying to nurse and the mama would just ram it again. So I just would come in the barn, grab the mama with one hand, and the baby with the other, and push the mom against the wall and hold her there. She would fight me like crazy. The baby was terrified of the mom at first, but then I showed it that she was going to be able to hurt it, and the baby started nursing. So after that I kept the baby in the house with me so the mom wouldn't hurt it, and every 3-4 hours I would take the baby out and let it feed. The part that sucked was the barn was about an acre away from my house, so in the middle of the night I would have to go out there and let the baby feed while the mom tried to kill it and myself, all while I was cold and tired. Running a ranch was a lot of work. I went from living with my parents in the suburbs to moving out and renting a ranch for my first house. I learned a lot. Big change in life.   Edit. I just dug up photos of the baby goat. Sorry for the quality this was a long time ago.   [Album](http://imgur.com/a/yCzO5)
c8cvqr8	5	0	that is one of the saddest stories I have ever read. ever.
c8cwo32	16	1	Its life on a ranch. Nature is rough. But it was sad, however the baby goat had a better life because of it. He basically just assumed I was his mother, and bonded with me. When it got older I would pull down my long gravel driveway he would hear my truck and start yelling for me. BAHHHHH, BAAAHHHHHH, BAAAAAHHHHH. So I would come and open the gate to the field and let him be free and run around the front yard with me. He would come out of the field running and bucking and doing these happy sideways kicks with his back legs. It made the other goats jealous that he got to eat the front yard grass.   
c8cxv7n	3	0	Holy shit that was such a cool story, and that's a damn nice little goat!  I always wanted a pet that attacked things like a Pokemon...
c8cxyqz	2	0	Thanks! Goats are great pets! So cute and fun, but they can not be domesticated. You can never house break a goat. You can kinda teach them not to pee in the house, but never the poop. They poop at random and are not even aware they are pooping. Luckily its really easy to clean up because its just little pellets. But they are awesome outdoor pets. Kinda like a really stupid dog. They can be really sweet (if you neuter the males) when you raise them from a baby. But they wont be able to be taught commands or rules. 
c8d02wg	2	0	My mom was like that
c8cvr9v	7	15	^^^ THIS is why I am not a vegan and (mostly) hate fucking vegans.  Carnivores FTW. Goats milk and goats cheese is fucking delicious, I don't understand some peoples aversion to it.  Also, Jamaican style Goat Curry is hot and delicious! Damn I've got a hunger pang and all I have is Beef...
c8cwmmk	4	3	Some people can't *physically* stomach that kind of thing. Why the fuck would that make you hate them? 
c8cxk2d	3	3	Because the ones I hate (and most of them I have had the pleasure of) are sanctimonious twats. I've never met a vegan who has a real disease that dissalows meat or dairy. I do have lactose intolerant cousins, but they eat meat just like me.  Generally your average Vegan is also a fucking nutjob signed up with PeTA, Greenpeace, and other "green" political charities. They are also upper middle class trustafarians living on daddies money or business connections for their hippy lifestyle. They are overrepresented on Reddit too, using their latest Apple Iphone/Ipad to feign outrageousness at mainstream, working class, life.
c8cy6cm	3	0	I really don't understand everyone's major hatred towards vegetarians/vegans. They always complain about them trying to shove their PETA beliefs down their throats, etc. but I have never experienced that anywhere around here. Is it a major thing in the states or something? I haven't eaten pork, chicken or red meat in almost a decade because my body physically cannot handle it. On a regular basis I get told I should eat meat. (Which is *exactly* like vegetarians/vegans saying you shouldn't eat meat.) Don't you think I MISS eating those things and that I want to, but it's like drinking alcohol and having the worst hangover you could possibly have: it just isn't worth it to me.  I'm constantly getting *labeled* as a vegetarian without classifying myself as one. Do you know how shitty that is? It fucking sucks because then I get harassed because they think I belong to PETA and the like.   Please just realize there are people who aren't dicks about their diets and it isn't fair when you generalize all of us "vegans/vegetarians" into a douchey category.

c8cw8zt	4	0	Yeah, I hold his head with my left hand, and with my thumb and index finger I open his mouth and idk how to describe how I insert that damn flimsy nipple. He is a Katahdin baby ram btw. http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/katahdin/ and the rams look pretty cool when grown up.

c8cxl5h	2	0	You are currently bottle feeding him because of nature...no matter how you look at it. The mother abandoned it because she knew he was gone. No use in HER putting energy into something that is just gonna die in a few days.   Ewe on the other hand have a lot of energy. 
c8cribs	134	18	use this phrase in your title they said. it would get you upvotes they said.
c8ct5ut	83	10	it *did*

c8ctfgv	23	4	Thats why they said it. They just wanted to help out

c8cv56v	4	0	Is that Lamancha a mix? It's ear looks floppy.  On a side note, Lamanchas are my favorite simply because of their ears. And mixing a Lamancha with a Nubian makes their ears hilariously soft little floppy stubs. Numanchas. Haha. It doesn't hurt that they have a nice temperament, as well.
c8cva8q	4	0	Hahaha! Seriously hilarious for any farmer!  I agree, the lamanchas are super chill! Nubians are wicked loud and we try to keep them out as much as possible!!!
c8csu65	30	3	It would be a lot of hard work they said. They being anyone who knows anything about farming.
c8cv623	7	1	I went to school with a lot of farm kids. Those kids were stronger than the football players, even thought the football players lifted weights. It's tough work, 24-7-365. 
c8cvky7	9	0	FArm boy here myself it is a tough life for sure but you get used to it after awhile and our football team was nothing BUT farm boys. We always killed in football because that's all we were ever really gonna be able to compete in we were all gonna be farmers and we knew it
c8cwcjt	7	1	Not gonna lie; that last bit was a little inspirational. Farmers are important and admirable. It must have been comforting to be so confident of your place in the world. 
c8cwezp	7	0	It's pretty nice actually for the most part it's a stress free lifestyle we don't have to do it but we will always have something to fall back on. Nice thing is I got in a shitload of trouble as a teenager and it doesn't matter now. 
c8cw381	3	1	Not gonna lie, that last bit was a little depressing.

c8cw37a	2	0	~~Funny story~~ Sort of amusing story, a few years ago I was out at an interview and it snowed quite heavily.  We were stuck in the car and the snow was over my knees. I'm 6'5" so it was quite deep.  Further up the road it was apparently over 6' deep.  We were about 50 miles from home, so when police told us to take a different route, we decided to stay in a hotel.  Thankfully a lot of the roads had been cleared by snow ploughs and police land rovers.  Everywhere was full so we drove around and eventually found a bed and breakfast, which was also a farm.  ****This is where the story stops being at all funny.****  We went out the next day to the barn to see some sheep and shit.  To get there we had to pass a path containing about ten sheep that had frozen to death.  What a way to go...

c8cv4xv	12	0	I see it often described as such: we see our reflection in the mirror most often but in photos the image technically appears reversed to us so we interpret our image differently, often negatively. For me, I can like my strut in a mirror, but the moment you show me a photo of myself I can't get any uglier.

c8cv7ap	3	0	I can relate, but in my experience, there's like a 3-4 day window of awesome hair. Then after that, you gotta just try to style it different ways to make use of the length. then after that, it's "get a fucking haircut, you hippy."

c8cvqg0	49	10	Thanks mom
c8cx60g	5	0	I really do need to thank my mom though. My entire life she had a little phrase she'd say to me in Korean "you have to thank me for making you so cute." She'd literally say this to me every day, and I never really thought much of it, but I am one of the most outgoing guys now and I really think it's because my mom never once let me feel ugly.
c8cx9k3	2	0	Aww, that's pretty sweet.
c8cwmb5	3	2	Thats just something that ugly people say.
c8cwa4b	6	0	It comes with being unattractive.  It's not like ya can't tell.
c8ctjcc	16	2	Yup, my bathroom's light is never on, I turn the hallway light and if I want to look at myself in the mirror I use that, under direct light I'm just ruining my own day
c8cu859	6	0	I find that hallway light casts very weird shadows across my face....
c8culj8	9	4	I'm exactly the same. I hate shaving every morning because it means staring at myself with direct lighting. Getting a haircut is even worse. 
c8cvxuu	4	0	Shaving is even worse when your facial hair is so thick that the lighting in the bathroom reveals the hair under your skin and you still look like you haven't shaved even after you have. 
c8cwj3y	2	0	Haircuts are the worst.  Bad lighting and at least 20 minutes of staring.
c8cuig6	6	1	I usually try just looking at my hair (I'm a guy) so I don't need makeup, it helps to just look at hair and get the hell outta the bathroom
c8cul8c	6	0	Yeah I focus on my eyes because I like that they're blue and doing my eye shadow and stuff is fun and pretty. 
c8cx766	1	0	I bet your eyes are gorgeous.
c8cwwtt	2	0	Every time I pass a mirror I have to wink so I don't catch a glimpse of myself out of the corner of that eye.  I am a sad pathetic man.
c8ctb3k	36	5	I'm the male version of that chick from the episode of Seinfeld who's sometimes smoking hot, and other times ugly as hell. Every morning I have to look into the mirror for my moment of truth to see which one I am that day.
c8cudm2	17	7	different lighting in different room/settings will make you look either ugly or good looking which can be confusing.  **If you really want to know what you truly look like, take a large mirror and go outside on a sunny day and stare at yourself. The lighting from the real world will give you an unbiased reflection of what you really look like to others.**  All other lighting i.e incandescent, florescent etc. will give you a false image of your self.   
c8cul5n	12	2	I know what you're saying but there's no point in me looking awesome in sunlight. I spend my days in an office bathed in fluorescent light. Something I have noticed is weird bumps and troughs in my face that I only seem to see in shop windows. Disconcerting.
c8cuy5m	3	0	I know exactly what you mean. My nose takes different shapes depending on the light. It looks good in sunlight but if there's only one light source in a room it looks awkward.
c8cv6u0	12	2	Thanks for that, NiggerNeedWhitePussy.
c8cvy0y	5	0	I'm scared to know the truth...I don't know that I can handle it.
c8cw4xc	1	0	But if people saw me looking at myself in a mirror outside they would consider me strange, which is an unattractive trait. 
c8cwn1a	2	0	It's quirky and eccentric.  
c8cwmm0	1	0	You're right but I actually have good and bad days regardless of light.  I retain water sometimes so I get puffy eyes and a double chin which I don't normally have.  Long story short, I need to cut down on my sodium intake.  Or embrace my hideousness.

c8ctg9v	32	2	You seem to have a weird notion that stand up comics have to have a bunch of different voices
c8cthvn	6	2	I don't think that at all. Not even close. Jim Gaffigans is just so distinct that when he does the voice it's all I can think about. The voice it's self is a joke and he uses it at the tail end of almost every actual joke/punchline.

c8cvahi	5	5	"I'm so retarded to believe that body matters more than face" -you
c8cvmq1	2	1	Your face is part of your body.  If you are out of shape, it shows in your face.  Guys with athletic builds generally are going to have a more attractive face than someone who is overweight or skinny-fat.
c8cvr7q	2	1	I'm not talking about some fat guy who face is all fat. A scrawny kid with a pretty face ill shit over someone with a worse face, even if his bodies good. You think anyone would give a single fuck about David Beckham or Mark Wahlberg if they didn't have a good face? Nope. Think of face as a cake. If it's a shitty cake, it doesn't really matter how much frosting (body) is on it.
c8cwchf	1	1	It's a lot less common for a face to be ugly than it is for someone to have an unattractive body.  An average face with an above average body will be much more desireable than an above average face with an out of shape body.
c8cyqs3	1	1	Average faces are dog shit. Women rate 80% of men as below average. And I'm sure a few of those men have nice bodies. A good face is the most important thing you can ever have in your whole life. If your face is lacking, and you're not captain charisma, then enjoy getting cheated on your whole life.

c8ct7vj	8	1	Sometimes I have a girlfriend in my reflection, and then I laugh because I know the mirror is wrong.
c8ctmnd	4	0	supposedly your mind actually compensates and make you think you look more attractive than you truly do!
c8ctoij	18	3	well that is a very, very sad fact if it is true.  
c8ctvym	8	1	Perhaps the mechanism works in reverse. So, if you're confident in your looks, then you are tricked into thinking you look better than you really do when looking upon a mirror, but if you're unconfident in your looks, then you trick yourself into thinking you look worse than you really do when looking upon a mirror.
c8cw9o7	3	0	I hope that's the case. I can't believe someone as ugly as me is even allowed to exist. Like why haven't they just taken me out back and ended it.
c8ctvtt	9	2	I must be really hideous then. 
c8cy8pl	2	0	You are not alone friend
c8cwob5	1	0	The reverse is true for pics.  We are used to compensating so we continue to compensate but the image is reversed so it makes us look twice as bad.  We are between a mirror and a pic in real life.

c8cvm23	3	0	I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.  This is all Jim needs to do.

c8cwmhu	1	0	As a person with BDD (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder) I have become pretty aware of practical techniques throughout the years. Only look at yourself when you're in a good state of mind. Try not to look at yourself too periodically. Like when you go to the bathroom in public or work/school think pleasant thoughts and take a minute to take deep breathes while your whizzing or at your desk prior the bathroom break.  when you stop at the sink, don't scrutinize your mug and your get-up for imperfection. Calmly look up and pleasantly note. "dang, although my hair isn't perfection today, I sure do have nice eyes." Or "hmm, I see I got a pimple on my nose, better be sure to pot the sucker when I get home! But this dress shirt is looking pretty fresh with these jeans today."  take notice of the "problem" area, and simply let it go. (easier said the. done, but just keep practicing). You gotta remember nobody really gives even 1%of the shit you think they give about you, trust me. Nobody is gonna be like "jesus, does carl ever wash? How is a gross, pimply guy like that gonna get anywhere in life?" even if someone actually though up some shallow garbage like that, just say "fuck 'em". Feel sorry for them. they are insecure about themselves and try to put others below them as a way of making them feel better.  Anyway, Wash you hands with soap and hot  water for a minute. (Preventing grimy/greasy hands helps acne a lot because if you're like me, you're always touching your face, or propping your head up on your palm in class)       So after you're done washing your hands, splash some cold water on your face (helps your face from looking/feeling greasy. this helps especially If you are under a lot of fluorescent lighting, under a lot of stress, and/or lacking sleep. It helps prevent acne, it feels good, and it's a good way to jolt you into alertness for a good while.) Try not to frequently look or gaze into your reflection in car windows, framed picture, or really any other reflective surfaces. It gives you an obscured version of yourself, and may be worrisome. Relax, it's a fluke! You gotta realize you can't control everything, and that people don't dwell over how you look. Almost everyone worries about there look to some degree. you are most defenetly not alone in any way. Take like 15-20 minutes each night for a little quite time (meditation, if you will) to unwind, and think about your day. It really helps. After your done, just take like 3 minutes and sit/stand at a mirror and note all the positives and negatives about your appearance.  Realize you are what you are, and you're only human. You should be happy for wanting to be the best you can be. Know that stress can seriously have a huge effect on how we perceive ourselves. Work on alleviating the stresses in your life. Buy a portable water bottle and drink like a fish.  Eat healthful food you can feel good about. just enjoy yourself and your life. Don't beat yourself up about small things, and take the time to relax and do the things you enjoy. You don't have to be a glutton, and over indulge! Be thankful for all the working organs you have, and all the limbs and fingers and bones you have.  You are an immensely complex being with complex thoughts and emotions. This complexness is how you're even able to perceive these problems that don't/barely  exist.  (Sorry about writing this on mobile!) TL;DR: Don't worry, be happy.
c8cwmr9	2	0	Only in bad lighting, but otherwise, no. Personally, I don't think it matters. You look back in time, and who is remembered? Who is considered great? It isn't that one really cute guy who worked as an apprentice book binder. It was that really short guy who nearly conquered all of Europe, that short and sickly man who wrote amazing poetry and from whom originated many sayings that we still use today, it was that guy who was stuck in wheel chair who pulled America up out of the greate depression. (Napoleon, Alexander Pope, F.D.R). Be a great person, a person of quality and integrity. That is what matters in the end, and that is what is attractive.

c8cy9t6	2	0	What did he say? It's been deleted and I'm curious.

c8cuhqb	4	1	When I was living on my own I used to just use solo cups haha
c8cuo86	1	0	It makes it easier to swish the cereal if you are holding the glass palm upwards above the stem. You'd probably look about 3 classes higher in some countries as well if you do it while mingling with house guests.
c8cvbpp	2	1	A 'glassy' solution. Used to eat mashed potatoes out of the casserole I made it in.. Also.. How you dooin'?

c8cznkb	1	0	I do believe that was the insinuation.
c8cwk5x	1	0	now you just have to wash the wine glass at some point.  which is why i generally eat my cereal out of solo cups. 
c8cx3na	1	0	Been there, done that. It works pretty well!
c8cx6oj	1	0	Great choice 
c8cxi8z	1	0	I had a friend turn me on to eating cereal in big cups. Spillage occurs much less frequently with cups than with shallow but wide bowls or even bowls in general.
c8cz6qk	2	0	I use a coffee mug. Definitely a lot easier.
c8cz9ev	1	0	A big one? I am a big bowl of cereal kind of guy and my first mental image of a coffee mug makes me think I'd have to eat at least two or three to be satisfied. I use big plastic cups.
c8czdyy	2	0	Fill it up to the top, pour milk, refill once. It's usually enough. Although if its Chocolate Chex, round three and sometimes four are necessary.
c8czgdj	1	0	Hell, regular rice chex keep me coming back for more. Granted, I am probably stoned if I am eating cereal.
c8cxxv1	1	0	I went on a camping trip, and all we had to eat out of besides plastic plates was Solo cups. Good for all manner of things
c8cxzz4	1	0	Spiffing.

c8cyeuc	1	0	[My bowls were also dirty.](http://i.imgur.com/S9opIyI.jpg)
c8cyl1f	3	0	No. The classy solution is dish soap, water, and a freshly cleaned bowl.
c8cylqw	1	0	I use plastic solo cups for cereal.   Why not use a cup???   It actually works better than using a bowl.
c8cyluj	1	0	The pinky in the air really does it for me, classy as shit
c8cztm1	1	0	technically, the pinky should never point.  it should be curled.

c8cz147	1	0	im a student. this is how i eat most things.  or save the washing of a cup and fill the cereal bag with milk..
c8cz5br	2	0	bitch please your elbows are on the table.  
c8cz9y6	1	0	Now I need to go out and get some Lucky Charms......I hope you're happy  with yourself. Seriously though, Lucky Charms are the tits.
c8czc9s	1	0	I did that last week... for dinner.
c8czenc	1	1	You know you are a true stoner whenever you read bowls and [think](http://www.421flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/glass_collection.jpg)
c8czgto	1	1	so you don't have time to wash a single bowl but find the time to take pictures of yourself eating from a glass and then uploading to redditt...
c8czkgg	1	0	I like your style. Carry on.
c8czpkp	1	0	This is a rookie move.  This cup is far too tall and narrow to be an effective cereal holder.  When I run out of bowls I put a layer or two of saran wrap in my snowboard helmet to turn it into a bowl.  You cannot get a good mix of milk and cereal with the setup you are running.  Think outside the box.  I expect better next time, soldier.
c8czq9j	1	0	Holy fuck. I did the exact same thing with my Kix this morning.  I own more wine glasses than anything else so I didn't bother washing a bowl
c8czqpl	1	0	Your not ovulating yet....
c8czup9	1	0	should have washed them, you're a woman.
c8czvya	1	0	I feel like this was a "I don't know what to do with my hands" kind of moment so you just stuck that pinky out there for the whole world to see.

c8d0e1d	2	0	Wash up a fucking bowl, it takes like 30 seconds....stop being a karma whore.
c8d0jp8	2	1	I hate you.I'm not saying this jokingly. I really do hate you.
c8d0k90	1	0	Pandering. 
c8d0mhm	1	0	You seem fun, you're sexy, and you have good taste in cereal, but I fear the day I ask you to make me a sandwich. 
c8d0opt	1	0	I've never seen so many people angry over dirty dishes before. Not only did they forget that it's just a joke, I **guarantee** that a lot of them have a sink full of dirty dishes themselves right now.
c8d0pa7	1	0	how about you wash them, what kind of woman are you?

c8d0fmj	1	0	Yes, the classiest. 
c8cuicw	12	16	Something about you being to lazy to wash out a fucking bowl makes me think you are spoiled rotten.   Not saying I hate you because of it, I just want you to die.

c8crvl3	10	0	He married his first wife after he had a child out of wedlock with her. Nobody knows what happened to his first daughter. His other two sons did really smart people stuff. He later divorced his first wife after they were separated for a while where he put weird rules in the house regarding them being together.  He later married his first cousin during their marriage he had extramarital affairs with other women.  All during this time, he created his papers on the Theory of General and Special Relativity, created his paper with the equation for the photoelectric effect (which would be what he receives his Nobel Prize in Physics for), created the equation of mass-energy equivalence, and even helped with diplomatic issues between Germany and France (not sure if those were the right countries).

c8crtng	16	4	Wow. Just wow. You pretty much nailed them all! The last bottle on the right is sweet white wine.
c8cs4rl	6	0	isn't Fat Tire out of Colorado? Although, I guess it's pretty much sold nationally.
c8csga2	6	0	It is. New Belgium Brewery in Fort Collins, CO. Unfortunately not available where I currently reside. I fell in love with it when I lived in Denver and is required drinking for every visit!
c8csl0y	3	0	I feel your pain. I used to live in Kansas City.... oh man, I miss my local brewery, Boulevard beer.
c8ctdrf	3	0	I once met a slightly intoxicated and very friendly Kansas Citian at the Schlafly tap room in St. Louis who was very insistent that I get my hands on some Boulevard beer. Loved everything I've had by them since. Tank 7 is glorious.

c8csdvm	6	1	I see  Brooklyn Local 2, New Belgium's Fat Tire, Lagunita's Wilco Tango Foxtrot, Dogfish Head's Bitches Brew, and Theobroma? Not sure on that last one. The bottle would suggest another dogfish head beer though.

c8cro6d	35	3	&gt;Albert Einstein's second wife was Elsa Einstein, whose mother Fanny Koch was the sister of Albert's mother, and whose father Rudolf Einstein was the son of Raphael Einstein, a brother of Albert's paternal grandfather. Thus Albert and Elsa were first cousins through their mothers and second cousins through their fathers.  what
c8crvl3	10	0	He married his first wife after he had a child out of wedlock with her. Nobody knows what happened to his first daughter. His other two sons did really smart people stuff. He later divorced his first wife after they were separated for a while where he put weird rules in the house regarding them being together.  He later married his first cousin during their marriage he had extramarital affairs with other women.  All during this time, he created his papers on the Theory of General and Special Relativity, created his paper with the equation for the photoelectric effect (which would be what he receives his Nobel Prize in Physics for), created the equation of mass-energy equivalence, and even helped with diplomatic issues between Germany and France (not sure if those were the right countries).
c8csijk	6	0	It makes me happy to see people pointing out that he won the Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect - which most non-physics-types don't even realize Einstein worked on - and not for his work on relativity.

c8cs6i9	49	4	Picture where you see somebody looking at you creepily have the word "Soon" added to make it funny. [Like here.](http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120224/640/soon_meme_collection_640_03.jpg) Einstein developed the theory of relativity so it says "Relatively soon."

Evergreens always have leaves on them, even in the dead of winter when it was very hard for anything to survive. We keep them in our house to remind us that we can and will endure even the roughest of times.

c8cuccm	12	13	I like most of his jokes, but Christmas trees are not a Christian tradition..
c8cv13v	12	6	I'm pretty sure Christmas trees are a Christian tradition.   Tree worship, of course, is much older than that but -&gt; Christmas trees &lt;- are, by definition, "decorated trees associacted with Christmas Day", and as Christmas Day is, by definition, "an annual commemoration of the birth of Jesus Christ", Christmas trees definitly are a Christian tradition.   Of course similar celebrations have existed before, but not under this name and this spirit. 
c8cwihe	2	0	I'm not sure if it's legend or not, but apparently LIT christmas trees started with [Martin Luther](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) (not "King, Jr.", but the guy he was named after) noticing stars shining through trees outside, and thought of using candles for the same effect.

c8cvqr9	10	2	She did and she felt great about it as she was handed the fat check for saying it

c8ctppg	13	0	The purse saleswoman. 
c8cv275	8	0	So Amy Adams. 
c8cuw9v	5	2	I just realized what you meant after reading some other comments. When you say "3rd best thing", you really mean the 3rd hottest woman to be on the show. I was really confused at first, because she was barely funny at all, if ever.
c8cv135	4	0	Oh no, Rashida is definitely the most beautiful ever on the show, I just meant that some of the writing and moments were higher on the list of great things of the Office. 
c8cwvhb	5	1	No, did she ever win the hottest in the office award? I think not, the most beautiful person is obviously Ryan who has 3 dundie awards that PROVE how hot he is

c8cth1v	27	4	Funny because [she wants a baby](/spoiler) in Parks and Rec. I thought someone leaked scenes from the next episode thats not even out yet. 
c8ctq3f	6	2	I remember NBC once leaked a promo for a much further episode (the one where Andy and April get married.) Meanwhile, in the episode where this promo was shown, the two aren't even dating yet!

c8csphm	64	11	Creed is one of those characters that have a small role, but cause big laughs.
c8cu3wz	15	2	this is why my penis is named Creed   also, it makes the earth and my dreams the same 
c8ct2zw	53	9	Rashida Jones is crazy cute. She's not one of those outwardly sexual, "super hot" starlets, she's just undeniably attractive and seems like a good person. Or maybe that's just Anne from Parks and Rec... I've never met Rashida Jones. She could be a bitch. I doubt it, though. 
c8ctz0r	34	3	She wrote [this](http://www.racialicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Rashida-Jones-letter-to-Tupac.jpg) when she was 18. She is amazing.

c8ct4fv	28	1	You've got to love Kevin too. Some of the things he says are pure gold
c8ctd14	43	7	67, 68, 69... *smiles*... 70, 71, 72...
c8cv478	20	5	Older Kevin, though. Seasons 2-4 Kevin was great, but as the show went on he just got more and more annoying. They actually pretty much turned him into a mentally handicapped accountant. 
c8cw09e	8	6	Yeah, I'm going to have to go ahead and vehemently disagree with that. It's more like the opposite. He used to be essentially retarded. Now he's often almost clever. Like when he won the Gay Bar Quiz. Or when he stole money by playing Dallas. 
c8cwa3a	5	1	Pretending to be a baby and crying at Pam's breasts after her pregnancy, putting his feet in an ice machine, and eating cake with a stapler (?) are all really clever.
c8d0cb4	1	0	Kevin's fucking awesome. Let's just end it at that, guys.

c8ctnza	15	3	Both of them were funny in the earlier episodes. Only reason Toby was ever funny was because of how much Michael ripped on him. Kevin went from being stupid funny to straight up mentally challenged.

c8cz3r3	2	0	False.
c8ct0c2	19	29	Idk man.... Robert California. As someone who loved Boston Legal, James Spader was the best thing to happen to the Office.  edit: Oh yeah? Well I think you're all retarded. I STAND BY MY OPINION
c8cv5ce	3	0	Why the fuck is this man downvoted for his opinion? Robert "The lizard king" California was an awesome character!
c8csrgh	24	3	Is it me or are "The Office" memes/pictures getting more and more frequent? 
c8ct093	42	8	Yeah but I'm okay with that 
c8ctu53	27	5	More Office and less Family Guy, please.

c8cung7	1	2	I wish more Redditors would post more stills from sitcoms - they're ALWAYS so funny
c8ct6bi	8	21	That's so funny! It was funny when the writers of the office wrote it, it was funny when the actors acted it, but it wasn't funny when you screencapped it and added subtitles to it for karma.   It's not even like you came up with this....not even remotely...
c8ct947	7	2	And neither is your post. 
c8ctmgs	1	7	Zing! Except I wasn't trying to be funny. Nice try, though! 
c8ctwi1	7	1	I know - you were being an annoying twat.

c8cvsqb	42	14	Getting tricked into going to /r/spacedicks is the closest thing reddit has to an initiation. Anyone who has been there knows what I'm talking about. Anyone who hasn't, don't worry. It's like /r/aww but better.

c8d0qjp	1	0	It's in New York. That is actually my school. This is terrible. The guy who posted this was in my geometry class until 2 weeks ago. I cant believe that this happened. Nothing is supposed to happen here.
c8cwzss	3	0	I hate how that is seen as the worst part of the internet you can find. Those are actually people with some sense of morals and who just seek some shock moments. The terrifying part is when you have a feeling of a total vacuum of moral or empathy for other people when browsing a site.
c8cxv2b	2	1	I've seen that, written in a bathroom at virginia tech
c8cx9or	5	2	so i'm actually going to defend the OP and say he was playing around in the library.  I have found some interesting things under tables when i was fucking around on the floor and shit.

c8ctnyg	15	8	I literally just watched this today...I don't think enough people will get this reference...and they should...
c8cr6xz	234	35	This is where you need a water gun with excellent range, just to see how many people you can convince it's raining. 
c8csng8	307	50	...or...or he could pee.

c8cuy45	6	2	Maybe birds poop brown poop? That they have white poop is just lies we tell ourselves so we don't have to think about the disgusting things people do to our cars.

c8cszub	15	5	Should have thrown an open water bottle with a spin, one of those big poland spring ones :D 
c8cta21	109	13	This kills the pedestrian.
c8ctdd5	17	9	Mythbusters already proved that a penny falling from a skyscraper wont, so I dont think a water bottle would.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_(2003_season)  Look at episode 4
c8ctex4	31	4	Well a water bottle would be a lot heavier and not have the same aerodynamic problems that a penny would. Also if it were sealed and full and landed cap-side down, I definitely wouldn't want that to hit me.
c8ctip3	30	1	If the water bottle were closed wouldn't that defeat the purpose of convincing people it's raining?
c8ctkew	10	1	I think it all depends on how much water comes out while it's falling. If it's even half full and lands on someone it'll injure them no doubt.
c8ctjri	6	0	he said *open* water bottle. with a spin. an empty bottle wouldnt hit with much force at all
c8ctn2b	6	0	A full Nalgene might be a different story.

c8cpm3y	1302	230	The dinosaur is good, but I honestly thought you guys were at a mini golf course and was looking for the photoshop for a while  Edit: so to clarify, I didn't realize that the shop was actually Rupert Grint. I haven't really watched Harry Potter and therefore don't really know what he looks like. I thought it was that the ex was replaced by a dinosaur, which caused me to just think that it was a group of friends at a mini golf course. Sorry for the confusion
c8cuz3u	23	0	I'm really glad I wasn't the only one thinking this.  I had two comments prepped:  A) Why didn't you replace the arm with a dinosaur claw?  B) That guy on the right looks familiar
c8cthnf	41	11	if you look closely and squint your eyes, you'll see that there's a dinosaur in the place of a supposed ex-boyfriend
c8cpu32	359	136	You REALLY couldn't tell what had been photoshopped into this photo........
c8cs77k	265	25	I couldn't. I thought that you were all posing infront of the dinosaur statue.
c8ctmm8	99	6	yea so did i...
c8cu7en	67	8	We may have the greatest photoshop artist on our hands here folks. 
c8cw4ef	33	6	WHICH IS IT?! Is it the fucking dinosaur, or is it Ron Weasley? Come on. I don't have time for this fucking Scooby-Doo mystery. I've got studying to do.
c8cw5xw	6	1	Dinosaur. Look at the hand all the way to the left. 
c8cxb5m	5	1	Nah that's the hand of the girl in the flowered skirt
c8cq4e7	349	48	You mean you didn't photoshop in Rupert Grint, better known as Ron Weasley? Mind=blown!
c8csl9c	143	23	My first reaction: Oh, haha, a dinosaur. Funny.  Second look at the photo. GOOD GOD THAT MAN IS EXACTLY LIKE RON WEASLEY!
c8ct4ba	232	34	I am that ginger man, and the Weasley comparisons *never* end.  Edit: Proof http://imgur.com/GaaIHPy
c8ctcqh	149	14	I still don't have proof that you have a right hand.

c8cxw4g	12	5	I am this roommate and dammit, I want in on this karma train
c8ctkrr	56	3	I was contemplating the morality of potentially telling a one-armed man that he has one arm...but you did it for me. Thank you.

c8ctwzj	14	0	if he doesn't, you'll feel like a huge asshole.
c8ctmdy	33	2	Actually with a head on shot, you look more like [Bill Weasley](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lixjy5OakV1qatzhuo1_400.jpg) (Domhnall Gleeson).
c8ct98b	13	0	To be fair, your hair style isn't helping the situation... 
c8ctn3c	35	5	I really don't mind the comparisons though. I am a huge Potter fan and as a kid it was the best thing ever to be told I was Ron/Fred/George/Charlie/Bill/Percy/~~Ginny~~. 
c8cts8w	27	4	I for one find you to be very attractive haha
c8ctu85	9	1	Now's about that time where you suggest he post in some LadyBoner-esque place for gingers/redheads...................
c8cu8t4	5	0	Hey Skylar
c8ctdwf	35	7	Next time that happens, close your eyes and take a very prolonged sniff of your index and middle fingers. Then take a deep sigh and say "mmm Hermione." Look the person right in the eyes, then just drop the mic and walk away.   You're welcome. 
c8ctg17	7	1	What happened to your right arm? Not attempting to be insensitive. It just looks like it's missing. And hopefully you at least have a story behind it. An interesting story. One that will satisfy my curiosity. Thank you. 
c8ctjdn	82	5	Well, this one time my buddies and I snuck into this government building and while in a section called the "Department of Mysteries" I accidentally touched a human brain that was floating in this tank. It damaged my arm pretty bad but I was just lucky to get out alive. My sister broke her ankle, and my best friend ended up watching his Godfather get killed. It was a rough night.

c8ctcoh	9	2	here's your upvote karma whore.
c8ct0yr	16	1	I thought the dinosaur was supposed to be there and the dude with the 3 chicks was photoshopped in. Look at his right arm, it goes, skin-blue-weird angle/lit hand.
c8ctvx6	6	0	I thought it was a picture in front of a dinosaur statue and you photoshopped Ron from harry potter over your ex boyfriend
c8cturv	5	0	Haha, I didn't even notice the dinosaur as out of place on first pass.
c8cu9kt	5	0	Yeah... I didn't get it either. Assumed mini golf. 
c8cto5b	8	2	Photoshop or not, you know who's arm that is.   ಠ_ಠ  You know. 
c8ct51t	2	1	along the back and hand on the far left side its pretty obvious. The areas with the most contrast difference between objects tend to give it away.
c8cvpks	4	0	Don't feel to bad...I thought the same thing and had to look at the picture again after I read your comment. Its just a guess but I think 740+ others did the same thing.
c8cve73	3	0	It's okay, I thought it was the dinosaur aswell..
c8crxsz	148	26	My mum cut out photos of her cats and taped them over my ex-husband in the photos she wanted to leave hanging on her walls (even my wedding photos!). My (now) husband saw this the first time he went to her house and loved her for it.  It's hilarious to see me standing next to a cat wearing a tuxedo. LOL.

c8cv6dk	12	0	Double dang
c8cqywe	307	42	Reddit has ruined me. I scanned the picture quick looking for the good part and all I cam up with is "OK group pic, dinosaur, people laughing... WTF where is it?!". Then I read the comments and face planted.
c8crktf	188	21	Facepalmed?
c8cruox	217	22	Hahaha no he felt so oblivious he fainted and fell on his face.
c8ct1ck	47	7	I think you're both reading it wrong. He really just wanted to plant his face so it could grow into a beautiful flower in a couple of weeks.

c8cs4xq	16	2	Sorry haha my sarcasm detection is at a low today :(
c8cua3f	24	1	It was 'bout that time I noticed my boyfriend was eight stories tall and a creature from the cretaceous period.  Then, my boyfriend leaned in and said, "I need about $3.50."
c8crdjo	152	33	I hope that you're keeping the originals, too. As someone who has had bad relationships in the past, it was cathartic at that time to destroy the reminders, and in effect attempt to "destroy" the memories. But as the years have passed and turned to decades, I regret that destruction. Those events helped mold me into who I am and not only that, it wasn't all bad or else I wouldn't have been in the relationships to begin with.   Tl;dr - don't be hasty in purging memories. You might regret it later. Instead, recognize them for what they are: pieces of your past that helped define who you are now.
c8ctahz	20	3	Yep, no need to Eternal Sunshine yourself. 
c8crfzw	92	64	He's a nice guy. We're not on bad terms.

c8cuivm	3	1	I second that. I have a bunch of old photos that I ruined, because an ex made me cut another ex out of them. That was 15 years ago, and now I really wish I had all those old memories recorded.
c8csf9n	8	3	Came here to say this. Glad to see it wasn't malicious. The harder you try to forget something, the harder it is to forget.
c8csytb	11	0	I seriously stared at the picture for 30 seconds thinking that it was a damn good photoshop of Ron Weasly
c8cu671	10	0	In summary, reddit hates that girls pants.
c8cqp7d	45	8	Is that Rupert Grint?
c8cqkfi	61	16	Someone needs to burn the redhead's pants. 
c8crpfw	22	3	the female redhead right? I was staring at the cute man's jeans trying to find out why people were annoyed.
c8crcqa	5	0	Oh god, why did you point that out.
c8cur2e	6	2	Don't be a bitter Internet nerd; that's just a fun, good looking crew of girls (and dudes).
c8csxrm	10	3	I wanted to ask where these girls are from. Where the hell on earth would that be stylish
c8cu3gn	6	1	No really... they need to be banished to the depths of fashion hell from whence they came.
c8crevb	14	3	What's up with those pants and where can I find some.
c8cs3jt	10	1	My god, I didn't even notice the dinosaur. I was sitting here thinking "no one has been removed, wtf?".. "Ther's nothing wrong with this picture"  I'm too stoned.
c8cuxyx	5	0	Laura Beth?
c8crr2g	408	172	I hope you're not going to be very offended by me saying that I think posting that pic is somewhat of a dick move. I'd be extremely hurt if I was your ex and came upon that photo, they are his memories too.
c8culsf	8	0	Maybe he killed her cat or something
c8csc56	204	78	Couldn't agree more. Further to that, it bothers me that people feels it's acceptable to remove people from photos.  If I suddenly wanted to remove someone from a photograph, I would hope that I would recognize that I am unable to move on and accept the past for what it was... OR that I am unwilling to accept that my life is not "Back to the Future".
c8ct4wc	52	1	Well if it was ok for Stalin, why can't others do it? 
c8cv61a	18	1	It wasn't okay for Stalin, he really hurt Trotsky by doing that. And then, to add insult to injury, rammed an ice pick his facehole.
c8ctl0p	18	6	Well, I look at it this way. Memories are hard to deal with sometimes. I go crazy when I cant forget about my past, remembering someone who I am not now. Pictures are a great way remember your past, kind of a memory in and of itself. But somethings you regret/don't want to remember, certain parts of a good memory, so instead of throwing away that memory entirely, you just block out the parts that you don't want to recall.  Sometimes it's hard to accept your past. Sometimes it's just easier to forget. 
c8cu6hh	18	0	Yeah but do you seriously see the photoshopped image and not still have the memory of what actually went on? I think removing someone from pictures is exceptionally stupid because even without seeing their face it would still bring back the memory of the event.   I'm perfectly okay with swapping people out for dinosaurs though. I think that should be a more common thing with or without the ex issue.
c8ct9h6	80	25	How do you know her Ex wasn't a dick? Besides, he must have his own copy of it, you know, being the digital age and all.
c8cttj5	14	9	OP did say he's a good guy and that they are on good terms. Sure, I'm aware that he probably has the original, but that is not what I meant. I can't say for sure, since I don't know these people, but breakups are never easy for anyone and that could have been a very fond memory of his. Ridiculing that memory could hurt loads.

c8cv0aw	4	1	I have never understood the need to erase a person from photos. Obviously they were important enough to you at the time the pic was taken. It's a part of your history, leave it alone.

c8cvnzt	12	7	For everyone who was concerned: I alerted exboyfriend to the fact that this was on the front page of Reddit, asked if he wanted me to take it down, and assured him that I didn't mean anything bad by it.   He's mostly just excited that I made it to the front page of Reddit.

Actually it wasn't hard. I found the source video in /r/youtubehaiku, made the video a Gif and reversed it to make the barrier closes before the train comes.

c8csjz4	25	2	1. Design printer that uses blood 2. Print out 100 copies of the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis 3. Sell to movie buffs for huge profits.
c8cs9yf	19	2	Actually crude oil is the best. Its the cheapest on the list and it's actually black.
c8cpe9v	1393	286	That is only the processing fee for blood. Like, how much it costs to have drawn.  Black market price of blood is about 350USD a pint, which works out to around 0.74USD per mL, marginally higher than the cost of ink.  Source: I sell organs on the black market
c8cqc7c	288	44	Confirmed, although my [source](http://m.gizmodo.com/5904129/heres-how-much-body-parts-cost-on-the-black-market) said $337 US per pint or $0.71 per mil.   However, I could not confirm Superpastaaisle's status as a black-marketer.

c8crygm	25	4	I would venture to guess more people have money problems than liver problems.
c8cshdh	12	3	It is illegal in USA. 
c8cswve	20	3	No problem, I'll just head to a country where it's legal. Here I come!!...Iran.  Well, shit.
c8css6g	14	1	Why is it so expensive? Humans are a dime a dozen and very easy to manufacture. Ink is hard to make.
c8cswd6	25	0	A lot actually goes into making humans.  They don't ripen for 18 years.
c8cv6te	16	0	They don't have to be ripe.

c8crmko	7	1	Welp, I'm off to sell my kidney. 
c8csjne	24	7	I think you could just make your money without selling an organ if you put those deep throat skills to good use!
c8cuasb	2	0	Must also factor in the cost of platelets and Plasma.  (cost of about 150 for a unit of plasma and 450 for a unit of platelets)
c8cv1fw	2	0	How much for testicles?
c8cvai1	3	0	Seriously though, how much is a gil. I'm starting to feel this
c8cvkxh	3	0	According to your source a "hand and forearm" sell for $50 more than a pint of blood. That doesn't make a lot of sense. 
c8crqxf	99	10	If you buy a black market organ, do you have to go to a sketch surgeon as well?  Or can you just go to your doctor and be like "yeah....I found this extra kidney that would be perfect for me!  When can we operate?"
c8csg96	69	5	*Found* a kidney? o_0  Yeah sure, just hop on the table. ...
c8cvei9	9	0	I think Surgeon Simulator 2013 can approve on that.
c8csspu	32	4	Not sure anyone gets away with that in developed countries, but it's a problem in China, India, and Bangladesh (that I know of).  Unfortunately, once you get back home it's a bitch to get hold of the immune meds.  You pretty much have to show up at a real transplant center and 'fess up.  We see someone like this every couple of years.
c8ct2c6	24	3	Do an IAmA.  This would be 10x better than most of the IAmA's we see.
c8ct02d	10	0	What do you guys do? I mean, its kinda late to put give it back isnt it? And you wouldnt wanna waste it. So do you guys operate if the patient has the money any everything and like have law enforcement waiting for when they recover?
c8ctyfy	7	0	Well, you can't actually prove that the transplanted organ was obtained illegally.  Some patients get legal transplant in other countries, too.  So you treat any complications and prescribe the meds.    The best approach is prevention through education of the dangers.  Between poor surgical technique, poor/no screening of donors for transmissible diseases or good match to the recipient, poor hygeine and post-surgical care, along with the stresses of travel back home just after surgery ... there are some pretty gruesome complications they face.
c8ctxip	4	0	The organ is already installed by that point. They just need the meds to prevent the body rejecting it.
c8ct8to	7	1	Your name ._.
c8ctmca	7	0	Heehee... I actually chose it  because I do genomic research (looking for changes in gene expression in liver cancer and transplant patients, mostly)

c8cqqwe	26	3	WTS some blood, half price 0+ and drug free.
c8cs59d	24	3	got any blood there comes with free drugs? Because drugs are expensive.

c8cquwe	28	8	Why do people buy organs and blood on the black market? Genuinely interested.

c8csuxd	3	0	I don't want hookers anywhere near my blood bank. Blackjack however, is welcome.
c8crkbk	12	0	And the blood you donate is likely sold :D.
c8cs660	7	0	Even as much as $337 if you would have sold it at the black market.
c8ct14s	3	0	Dude I'm O-,my body literally produces liquid gold but because the government thinks its ethically unsound to *sell* my blood as opposed to just giving the shit away, I can't cash in. Da Fuq.
c8cq664	406	56	This graphic would make more sense if it was ml/$, so the volume in the syringes would represent a volume and not dollars.
c8cr4zo	190	26	Yeah, at a glance the graph looks like it's saying "this is how much of these liquids you could get for X amount of money" so it implies that printer ink is vastly cheaper than any of the other ones.  Fancy graphics are alright, but I wish people would take a moment to think about what their graphics are actually saying, and whether or not they contradict the text.
c8cruef	41	7	Be nice, dude. They have a degree to justify.
c8cspnq	30	7	The graphics don't contradict the text, they're just very nonintuitive.

c8cshmg	14	3	It's sad because it's funnier than most of the stuff posted here
c8cqofj	13	0	I found the scale of this graph to be very misleading. 
c8cssvx	37	6	Why is this in r/funny?..
c8csuaq	11	3	because OP is faggot
c8csros	33	4	This is suppose to be funny?
c8csinu	31	5	Why is this funny...?
c8cqfye	46	8	am I the only on worried that water costs more than oil...
c8cqzfb	11	1	Its also because crude oil in the state it comes out of the ground is next to useless
c8cqign	81	17	No. It is because morons pay for bottled water.
c8cqp7b	25	5	Or those travelling in a foreign country where you aren't sure which bacteria are in the water and which ones are filtered out.  That's not to say that every other country is worse at filtering things ('MURICA!), but rather they have and filter different things. Most are relatively harmless but can cause minor issues like temporary diarrhea, even if filtered. Bottled water is pretty universal though.
c8crw7e	4	0	It's actually pretty interesting that sometimes the reason people get sick when they travel and drink foreign water isn't so much that the water isn't safe, because that country might have huge problems with sickness which some do, its that your body just isn't adjusted to the types of organisms that are in that areas water supply. While many places have diseases that are dangerous to everyone, sometimes you're just not adjusted to that areas water life. So people can get sick while drinking "safe" water.
c8cqz6p	13	11	Those are very extenuating circumstances. I'm talking about fuckheads in the 1st world who have great tap water, but are lazy and assholes who buy water for convenience. Obviously, in Mexico, or other places I'd buy bottled water because you just aren't sure. 
c8crcll	10	1	If you go to east Asia, minus Japan, you basically need to buy bottled water to be better safe than sorry.  I don't get why people in Australia (where I live) do it though. Tap water is incredibly clean here.
c8crcti	3	0	But then in places where you have to buy bottled water it isn't generally that expensive unless you just take the first thing you see.
c8crcyf	7	4	I tend to buy bottled water for the bottles.
c8csbnu	7	0	They make this remarkable thing called a reusable bottle.
c8cq7ir	26	7	I'm honestly so much more surprised that red bull costs more than vodka
c8cr3my	11	1	But it's lower on the graph, doesn't that mean it is the same if not slightly lower price?
c8cre6g	7	1	yeah I did hope no-one would point this out, I only realised after I'd posted, but they're basically the same price which still surprises me!
c8crezu	3	0	Either way, they are both overpriced if you ask me.
c8cqb3s	27	6	Red bull is fucking expensive.. It's like 8-9$ for a *four pack* of (8 oz?) cans. It's a goddamn joke and I refuse to buy it at such an inflated price. 
c8cqdj6	10	3	fuck me, that's ridiculous! Here in England they're expensive but you're looking at £4.00 (~$6.32) for a 4-pack whereas vodka is about £11 (~$17.50) for 70cl.
c8cqgay	10	1	70 centiliters? Ha, I've never ever heard people use that unit of measurement in the states. We call it .7 liters
c8cr7xg	6	0	That is a joke, you can find 4 packs for $6.  Source: I drink a shitload of Red Bull
c8crcua	5	3	Why? Vodka is basically ethanol and water. And red bull has much much more and more complex ingredients. 
c8cqybr	8	1	It's misleading in that for a printer, you're not just buying the ink, but the cartridge as well, which is a pretty hi-tech device. Still over-priced... my printer uses $60 worth of cartridges; I bought the whole printer a few years ago for $43. (Yes, I know the included cartridges are only partly filled.)
c8csuga	4	0	Why is this in funny?  Also, isn't it a wonderful triumph of medical service is this life-giving liquid is made available at less than the cost of ink?
c8cqi4r	14	4	Source of facts, please.
c8cqup3	6	1	Thats just because the vampire loby keeps the blood subsidies high. 
c8cr8ho	8	2	I will be filling my pens with crude oil then....
c8cre30	3	0	Well one is synthetic and has to be manufactured and the other is made by your body all the time.
c8crkr7	3	0	We do have a lot more blood just lying around.
c8cqqqe	3	2	As a designer, I would've aligned the words on top with the edge of the black ink syringe. It looks awkward the way it is.  Redo!

c8cqyf1	2	0	Lesson Learned: Fill all pens and printers with human blood. 
c8cr673	1	2	Not sure what brand they were pricing, but the vodka I buy costs less than Redbull. 
c8cr6jo	1	0	And they called me crazy for writing in my own blood!
c8cr79f	2	0	Where can I order human blood?
c8cr86j	2	0	I bet semen is even more expensive since donation sizes are smaller and donors are paid more. Molten gold is probably more expensive as well. Not sure what we're supposed to take away from this comparison, as blood isn't really exceedingly valuable (I am a bit surprised that it's as much as $0.40/mL).
c8cr9s3	1	1	Good, if blood were expensive think of the medical costs.
c8crcmr	2	0	Umm arn't all the prices the same on that graph? They all just have different amounts @ the same price...
c8crdcv	1	0	wait, where does this data come from?  bottled water is only 50% cheaper then redbull?
c8cre0y	1	0	And Vodka costs as much as Red Bull? I've been spending my Friday nights entirely wrong.
c8crfeh	1	1	Good! Blood is much more valuable to us. It's great if it's easier to obtain than ink.
c8crfrv	1	0	I already started using blood as my ink of choice!
c8crh16	2	0	So this is why Saddam wrote that Koran in his own blood. Ink was too expensive! 
c8cri4t	1	0	I also read that ounce-to-ounce, printer ink costs something like 10x what Dom Perignon champagne costs.
c8crjce	1	0	Even there vodka is right next to the Red Bull.  Clearly they're meant to be together.
c8crjsv	2	0	WTF, Reddit..  Almost 100 comments and not a single "the pen is mightier than the sword" pun? How disappointing...
c8crk4g	1	0	I'm sure this has been said, but I'm too lazy to check. Ink has such a great cost because they sell printers cheap. Or at least that's what they[producers] claim. The high ink costs are to offset the "cheap" printer costs. 
c8crkln	2	0	Bull semen runs between $20/ml and $400/ml.   Source - My friend explained to me why it's not that bad that his job involves giving bulls hand jobs.
c8crlga	1	0	Why is everyone taking this seriously? In reality, blood is a higher than $.70 per milliliter, and actual ink is way lower than $.7 (it turns out to be about $.20 per ml on the expensive end). It is the companies which exploit the ignorance of the buyers, which increases the ink's price.
c8crmry	1	0	Oil is cheaper than blood.  Ain't that the damn truth?  Edit: I a word

c8crpf0	1	0	Just out of curiosity, how many pages of standard type could I print before I pass out.  This is important.  I'm starting to feel woozy.
c8crpmv	2	0	Add more blood= same cost as ink.
c8crpox	1	1	Install a continuous ink supply system on your printer, you can drop the price of ink by a factor of 10. I bought one from adaptive inks and it's a bit of a hassle to install but the ink is HP quality, even the tanks are HP. Ink for my Officejet Pro 8500 cost $145 at Costco. I returned the cartridges and bought the system for $200. I can print color for about 1.5 cents a page.

c8crwo2	2	0	I call (red) bullshit. $54.99 for 2.25 gallons of red bull on amazon works out to somewhere around $.0064 per ml. The chart makes it look like red bull is around $.05. Big difference.  Somebody should check my numbers though, I'm sick in bed with a fever and was seeing gnomes earlier.
c8crwo3	1	0	Vodka and Red Bull appear to cost the same. Coincidence?
c8crx53	2	0	As it should- human blood is pretty common, and requires merely living to produce
c8crzd3	1	0	I would also like to point out that the quantities needed of human blood are much larger than that of ink. What doctor orders a mL of blood?

c8csbod	1	0	Why use HP45 as an example?  That is a bulk cartridge and they don't even make printers for that anymore.  HP61 is a more current cartridge and that contains about 5ml of ink at $18.25 on Amazon.
c8csbxc	2	0	I'm so happy everyone's using the metric system in this thread.
c8cscc2	1	0	HP charges so much for ink. If you want a printer that uses less ink and cheaper ink (alot cheaper) get a brother printer. 
c8cscxe	1	0	I'm more disturbed how bottled water cost more than Crude Oil.  That being said, I'm sure Coke Bottling Plants use the exact same water for their Coke products as Dasani water.

c8csmj5	2	0	Nice try, crude oil executive.
c8csn4q	2	0	So what you're really saying is, blood for oil is a pretty terrible deal from a purely economic standpoint?
c8csnae	2	0	What kind of magical water is this? 2 dollar per 100 ml? Standard bottle over here is 500 ml, so 10 dollar? If I where to go to the most expensive place I'd pay about €2.20 for it, maybe €2.50. If I'd buy them at a convenience store, it'd be €0.21 per 500 ml when buying them in a 6 pack, or 0.00042 EUR per ml, if you convert that to USD, it would be 0.00056 USD per ml...  And that is not even the cheapest alternative, for if you stay in a country where the water is not drinkable for foreigners, you often find a 5 to 7 liter alternative which would be even cheaper per ml.
c8csnap	1	0	HP ink #45 also hasn't been used in printers for years.  What most HP printers use right now is #564, which is $12 as compared to $40 a cartridge.  Printers are also a lot more efficient now than they were a couple years ago.    But, you know, pitchforks and all that.
c8csnzb	1	0	Ink is actually super cheap... look into recycled cartridges, what you're paying for when you buy brand new ones is the electronics on the cartridge.

c8cu5d6	21	34	[deleted]
c8cuac9	32	10	*groan* - *rolleyes*  Are you really so stupid that you think the point of this metaphor was about women being property?  
c8cuoe8	8	19	[deleted]
c8cuvsy	12	4	The point of the metaphor was to get the point across that he doesn't want people touching his car you fucking dope.  That's it.  Not any more complicated than that.
c8cvn31	3	2	They don't seem to notice the subject of the sign isn't the wife; it's the car. They were trying to think of a way to say "don't tough my car" not "don't touch my wife."
c8cub0w	21	7	So you want other men touching your partner that you are in a completely equal and fair sexual relationship with? Seriously, this politically bullshit is out of control
c8cv96n	4	3	As a person who has entered his car in a number of shows, you're an idiot. My dad and I both had a similar sign to put on our cars. Too many people will touch the tips of doors just for a closer peek of the interior. Also some turds lean over a fender to get a closer look at the engine compartment. Finger prints and belt buckle scratches are things that the car judges will notice. These people spend many hours detailing a car. Oh and by the way, most of the guys that have these signs on their cars are there with their wives. The intention behind the sign is to ask people to not get hand prints or scratches on the paint while trying to get a smile out of someone. I bet the guys wife even put the sign on the car. 
c8cti15	22	11	the comparison to valuable items, gold, jewels etc. that allows this to propagate uncontested in many countries. "She's more precious than gold, to me. So I have to hide her away or others will steal it" etc  it's equally scary how many girls feel complemented about the idea.
c8cu65i	8	1	Complimented*
c8cr746	27	20	Historically, pretty much.
c8cuabl	17	11	I like how people take offense to this, yet if a woman says "that's my husband! He's mine!" no one says "OMG MEN AREN"T PROPERRRRTAY!!!" 
c8cuqtp	11	10	Because historically, men have never been legally and practically treated like property. Women have, and in many places, still are.  [ninja edit] except slaves. Slaves are treated like property regardless of sex.
c8cv5xy	8	6	CptOblivion... more like [CptOblivious](http://www.niica.on.ca/diaspora/images/0A117.jpg)  Slavery still exist today.  But yea historically, men being forced into arms and work in deadly mines wasn't totally treated like property...  Ya you know that peasant who worked sun up to sundown to only die in a battlefield was a real lucky son of a bitch.  I cant believe Feminism has gotten to the point where they actively dismiss slavery of males.  
c8cvbjj	5	2	&gt;But yea historically, men being forced into arms and work in deadly mines wasn't totally treated like property... Ya you know that peasant who worked sun up to sundown to only die in a battlefield was a real lucky son of a bitch.  Aaand he'd still be above his wife when he got home.  Nice ninja edit.
c8cvejy	4	5	&gt;Aaand he'd still be above his wife when he got home.  Ya that peasant had so much power over his wife.  "Take care of the children while I go die in this war, if I live we will share the spoils of war."  "Just got back from working sun up to sun down, I could use some sex."  Sounds fucking terrible bro.
c8cvf50	3	2	So, you agree that slaves are treated like property, but you're saying it like you disagree? I'm confused. And don't try to pretend that the male serfs were treated as badly as the female ones. Women have always been lower on the social levels than men.  And yes, oblivion is the state of being oblivious, I'm constantly surprised by how many people like you have such poor vocabularies that they don't know that. My username is not a very complicated joke but people always feel the need to try to explain it to me as though I didn't realize it.
c8cvkga	2	6	&gt;So, you agree that slaves are treated like property, but you're saying it like you disagree? I'm confused.  No you claiming saying "I value my wife" is oppressive to the point of dehumanization.   Oblivion is forgotten. The forgotten Captain or "Ill throw you into oblivion" (unknown territory - exiled)  You would have to say Captain Oblivious to say he has the trait of being Oblivious.  "Ninja edit" You don't use Nouns as verbs u twit.  THe oblivion Captain took the helm. You  The oblivious Captain took the helm. Me  He was thrown into a state of Oblivion. Me  We was thrown into a state of Oblivious. You
c8cvxkp	2	4	If you are going to pick apart grammar, you would do well to spell words like "you" all the way out, and use apostrophes where they belong. It's very difficult to take you seriously otherwise.  Regardless, seeing as we've both moved into the territory of personal insults I think it's fair to say this debate is effectively over.
c8cwdhm	2	1	Wasn't picking apart grammar, you uneducated neanderthal.  We was arguing semantics.  I clearly can spell the word "you" all the way out.  Regardless, you did not argue my points so I assume you feel corrected.

c8cvlpc	3	0	heh well no I never really raced it much I did the occasional burn-out but I never really felt the need to race it, it was a heavy car and even though it would break the tires loose pretty easy it wasn't exactly a fast car, also if you have never driven a nova of that time period there was easly 1 inch of play in the steering and by that I mean you could never call it a well handling car.  That being said yes it very much so was a poon magnet it was a well known car at my school and there was always ladies who would love a ride and such.

c8csarn	1	0	Well, the phrase comes from mathematics, which in many cases something can be the *least* denominator without being the *lowest* denominator. While it makes more sense in mathematics, only a willful misinterpretation causes confusion even outside of it.

My SO saw his children 3 days a week before they left and we didn't see them for 9 months after because the laws for mothers are so fucked. Well when fnally (after thousands of dollars and fighting with lawyers) got them for a visit the little girl was so upset because her mom told her that her daddy didn't want her Anymore. She came and was very confused. When I was cooking dinner she threw a phone through the bathroom window and stuffed her clothes in the toilet. Now this was our only toilet. It took 5 days to get someone to fix everything! So be thankful you just have to clean the shower! Running to wendys whenever the kids had to use the bathroom was fucking gayTl;Dr angry 4 yo thew phone through window and stuffed her clothes in the only toilet and we couldn't get it fixed for days.

I died laughing, but I've googled it and come up dry and there are too many seasons to watch for that little bit of dialogue.

I guess this applies only to decisions that you actually have to stop and think about.    Or it could just be a funny line from a sitcom that doesn't invite real scrutiny, which would make me a pedantic asshole, which is also true.
c8csez6	1	6	So u dont breath?

c8cpv3s	813	78	5 is wrong.  the factorial should be outside the radical. 
c8crqcx	287	16	I'm glad I'm not the only who checked them and got stuck on the 5.
c8cuap8	99	11	They also used three 9's in each answer except for 1.  They should have done 9^(9-9).
c8cuitl	42	9	90?  EDIT: Thanks for the clarification!
c8cut0k	47	4	I assume you are on your phone and can't see the exponent.  It is 9\^(9-9)
c8cv9ax	34	0	Thanks, I thought I forgot some theorem where 90 magically equals 1
c8cyb3q	1	0	[deleted]
c8cyjnm	3	0	Wouldn't it be Base 89?
c8cz55u	2	0	Neither. If 90 were base 90 it would equal 90^9 in decimal and it base 89 it would be 89^9. Those do not equal one. If you were to go the other way around, 90 in base 90 would be represented by 10 in base 90 and 11 in base 89. No batter what base you're in, 1 is 1. 
c8cz3vq	1	0	90 would magically equal ten.  Just sayin'
c8cvdtq	3	0	Phew. Thanks!
c8cuk6k	24	3	9^9-9 = 9^0  =  1   edit what's up with reddit? don't downvote that guy, a small understanding that's all.
c8cukgw	5	2	anything to the power of 0 is 1.
c8cvhgr	8	2	anything except 0
c8cvy3u	7	2	It depends on your school of thought, but for use its use in certain proofs, Mathematicians consider 0^0 to be equal to 1  [source](http://www.askamathematician.com/2010/12/q-what-does-00-zero-raised-to-the-zeroth-power-equal-why-do-mathematicians-and-high-school-teachers-disagree/)
c8cwccu	3	0	As your source says, 0^0 = 1 because... well, pretty much because we say so.    The choice wasn't completely arbitrary, though.  It works out that having 0^0 = 1 happens to mesh well with the rest of mathematics.  I know, that's a totally unsatisfying answer.
c8cx526	3	0	It screws up some stuff though. Like consider the limit of 0^x as x-&gt; 0. Then consider x^0 as x-&gt; 0.  :/
c8cuxjv	2	0	yeah, that one disappointed me too
c8cx03t	1	1	I was thinking they could have gone with (9/9)^9 but I like yours better.
c8cv493	3	1	I checked it too... apparently, they prefer it to be 72*sqrt(70)-1 O'clock rather than just 5... lol
c8crfpy	23	1	Came here to say this. Have an upvote. At first I saw the 9! and was thinking that's way to high for a 5 unless i somehow forgot you could move factorials out of square roots but then that didn't make any sense at all. I was coming out with 212.9 and thought surely this well thought out clock wouldn't be. I figured I'd check the comments and see if anyone else saw it. Still a really fun clock though.
c8cu8xj	12	1	"Guys, I gotta go. I have a meeting later at ~601.395 o'clock." 
c8ctmql	10	0	Yeah? So maybe its intended to be 601 o'clock... Maybe the clock is for another time zone. Ever thought of that? Smart ass...
c8cpxvc	70	28	true. And i didn't run the proper check on karmadecay and just found the image is a repost =(  http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/sf07h/i_found_herman_cains_clock/  Am I a faggot? =(
c8cq0n4	30	2	Just a little bit. But seriously, has this only been posted once before?  I feel like I've seen it lots more. :O
c8cq847	6	0	There are a couple different types of math clocks so while this picture may have only been posted once before, the other ones have probably been posted a lot.
c8crokk	2	0	Yeah, that might be it. Or maybe hosted on other sites. Ah, whatever, I like the clock. :D
c8cs8vb	9	1	9 months ago. You're fine.
c8cr9ca	5	2	There isn't much you could have done about it. OP always is.
c8csavv	3	0	Just a quick tip. If you didn't make it, it has probably been posted before.
c8cx7mc	5	0	[fixed](http://i.imgur.com/NX3Im8P.jpg)
c8cuq8t	3	1	As a math person, 5 bugs me too. That factorial is in the wrong postilion.  As well as assuming that all square roots result in a positive number. 
c8cvtpq	10	0	I have always been taught that √x denotes the positive root, so all of these would be fine.  If it was something along the line of x^2 = 9 that would be ambiguous, as x could be 3 or -3, but √9 is 3, -√9 is -3, and ±√9 denotes the possibility of either 3 or -3.
c8d0l3b	1	0	I never learned that...It was always √9 = ±3, since 3^2 and (-3)^2 are both 9.  -√9 would be -(±3). *shrug*
c8cwnjm	3	0	a math *highschool* person? 
c8cwdai	1	0	By convention, the square root of a non-negative real number *x* is taken to be the non-negative value *y* satisfying *y^2 = x*.
c8cu8od	2	0	Thank you, I was wondering what the hell was up with 5.
c8cvf43	1	0	When I first saw this elsewhere, I tried to tell people, but my comment got lost in the crowd. But now I thank you for being quick about it over here and informing people. My irritation about this is now gone

c8cthxy	23	0	Yep, I was disappointed that 9 wasn't just... "9". 
c8cs76k	11	0	Because he uses three 9´s every time. Which is funny because they could n´t get 1...

c8ctvj8	3	0	5 is slightly misprinted.  It should be (√9)!, not √(9!).  The former is equal to 6, the latter is equal to some really big number.    An infinite string of 9's to the right of the decimal point is equal to one - that's what the bar means.  Therefore, 7:00 is 9 - √9 + 0.9999999....

c8cvani	1	0	9 something 
c8cve09	1	0	I too browse the skymall.
c8cvgy2	1	0	and almost all the square roots should have their absolute values taken.  
c8cvkri	1	0	It's nine.
c8cvkt2	1	0	this is not funny

c8cw3ov	1	0	4:30
c8cw3q7	1	0	Their equation for 3 isn't that clever.  √(9^√9) / 9 would be much better than √9 + 9 - 9
c8cwamm	1	0	The nine is just stupid. If you're going to try expressing every number using only nines and mathematical operators, then express nine as "9".
c8cwbt5	1	0	AAAAADVEN- oh...
c8cwc5y	1	0	So...after 4 comes 601.395219105 o'clock?  Doesn't quite seem to roll off the tongue like the ol' 5 o'clock did.
c8cwd0p	1	0	sqrt(9) is +/- 3.  Actually doing the math on these, this is what they equal:  1. 1 1. 2 1. {-3,3} 1. {-2,4} 1. {-603.4,601.4} 1. {6,12} 1. {7,13} 1. 8 1. 9 1. 10 1. 11 1. {6,12}

c8cwuoy	1	0	7:40
c8cwvt5	1	0	Apart from 5 being wrong I also don't like 7. 0.9 is not 9. It could be written 9-(!sqrt(9)/sqrt(9)).
c8cwx5y	1	0	hmmm I want to say 9...
c8cwy4p	1	0	It's coward killing time!
c8cwzs6	1	0	Fun fact: this can also be done using four fours to represent each number:  1 = 44/44  2 = (44 + 4)/(4!)  3 = (4+4+4)/4  4 = (-44) + 4! + 4!  5 = (44 - 4!)/4  6 = 4+((4+4)/4)  7 = 44/4 - 4  8 = ((4/4)*4) + 4  9 = 44/4 - √4  10 = (44 - 4)/4  11 = 44/(√4*√4)  12 = (44 + 4)/4
c8cx0jm	1	0	It's twenty five minutes to 9
c8cx1wm	1	0	Aint no body got time for that!
c8cx28f	1	0	3 is sqrt(9) + 9 - 9 Is that really necessary? 
c8cx8p7	1	0	nein
c8cx9js	1	0	It would've been so much better if 9 o'clock was just 9. 
c8cxoyy	1	0	&gt;What nine is it?   FTFY
c8cxydm	2	0	The square root of 9 factorial is 602.395. So it is 601.395 o'clock? Dumb karma whore shit.

c8cyhk5	1	0	Yeah, I hate clocks like this that make it hard to read the numbers because the hands are too short...
c8cymb2	1	0	They all have three nines but one. Whyyy. Edit: reminds of a game I used to play where you would count with four fours (or any four numbers really). Ex. (4+4)/(4+4) =1, (4/4)+(4/4)=2 etc. .444444444 counts as one four. Its a fun forum game or math class game at the end of the day.
c8cymzc	1	0	If you've seen a clock before its pretty easy to distinguish the time. Unless it has some weird movement. 
c8cyvc0	1	0	Great. I forgot how to tell time.

c8czg0u	1	1	That clock sure is dressed to the nines  Amirite ladies?
c8czgiw	1	0	9:35
c8czjaw	1	0	7 is also wrong. 9 and root 9 should be in parentheses, otherwise the order of operations gives you 5. 
c8czoq0	1	0	Aaaaaaaaaaadventure Time!

c8cw1v8	10	0	No, see, clearly Mt. Shasta photobombed that squirrel. 
c8cwval	2	0	Squirrel is in focus.
c8cx8sa	1	1	Oh sorry, my mistake
c8cyazh	2	4	Nope, was going for the mountain but the camera auto focused once the squirrel popped up. I would have had to be crazy fast to be able to catch the squirrel like this...well maybe not for others, but I personally don't have the talent.

Although few in number and often hostile to each other, in the 5 th century BC they were able to defeat their much larger neighbor, Persia, on land and sea.  Alexander, your people stand ready to march to war, to spread the great Greek culture to millions and to bring you everlasting glory. Are you ready to accept your destiny, King Alexander?

c8csj2n	1	0	took me a while to realize what I was supposed to be looking at. At first I thought we were talking about the dude's tiny hand
c8cskf9	1	0	The guys at the ball have classic soccer faces. Derp. 
c8cskyf	1	0	He's clearly breakdancing.
c8csm9h	1	0	u just mad he can break dance better than u
c8cso4f	1	0	How the hell-fuck did he manage that?

c8ctjr0	1	0	These aren't my glasses
c8ctkxm	1	0	That kind of fall happens occasionally going up for a contested header. It's weird that the ball is on the ground; but it's possible he cleared it and landed awkwardly like this just as another player controlled the ball on the ground.
c8ctodw	1	0	this is quite common in [football actually](http://i.imgur.com/zA1fTCF.jpg?1)
c8ctqdw	1	0	Is that Adam Sadler
c8ctv8w	1	0	It was a corner, he went up for a header and pushed on his marker's should to propel himself higher, and the weight sent him toppling forward on his face. 
c8ctxz2	1	0	He forgot how to soccer.  
c8cu29o	1	0	Better question.....how did they get Adam Sandler to play soccer with them?
c8cu4c3	1	0	that's my favorite part of watching high school football games. in any given play you can see a few people falling down for no reason other than football

c8cvh6k	1	0	Sometimes they just drop extra players onto the field.
c8cvnjo	1	0	Eventually the rules of soccer will change to the point where they will eliminate the ball and goals. It will just be a bunch of aspiring underwear models running around doing prat falls and acting hurt. It's not that far off now.

c8cy1fk	1	0	Has anyone said DERP yet?
c8cy2uo	1	0	I was playing some backyard American football with friends, had a great run to the end zone with my large friend right behind me, dove into the end zone, the momentum made me stand up like that and I kicked my large friend right in the jaw.  How's that for an end zone celebration?
c8cz413	1	0	Where's his foot?
c8cz581	1	0	Easy. It's positioning. He's a defender, has to adjust his positioning to the ball constantly. Boot gets caught in the grass and down he goes. Happened plenty of time to everyone who's ever done sports on grass. 
c8czq1m	1	0	Very carefully.
c8d011v	1	0	Reverse slide tackle.... I've done that before in a game or two as well...
c8d043j	1	0	He took diving in soccer to seriously. 
c8crb6m	4	1	Never underestimate a white person's propensity for clumsy shit while playing sports.
c8cqte5	5	8	He went for the dive to draw the foul. He just made it more realistic than [this guy.](http://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/gallery/gimages/suarezgif.gif) That's what I like to think anyway.

c8cow99	414	66	About time to get that fungus out of your nail.
c8cp7vi	262	40	Thanks for pointing out my flaw.  http://imgur.com/LkiOq0o Happy?
c8cpl7c	166	19	Today, OP was pretty cool.
c8cqgnh	36	7	How is it done without surgery?
c8cqq9e	26	4	Google Shopping for "nail fungus treatment", you get a fluid you apply to the nail, and in my case, some nail files to roughen the nail so the fluid gets down to the nail bed. 
c8crdy9	25	1	I mean, so I'm told
c8cs1t4	5	1	I've been carrying this shame around with me. I'm going to do this. Thank you.
c8csjoh	6	1	It's not an overnight treatment, supposedly can take up to 12 months, but if you stay the course, your nails will be healthy again.
c8cvajd	2	0	I've heard some of these treatments can be tough on the liver, especially since you need to treat for so long as you mentioned.  Have you heard anything similar?
c8cw74e	2	0	Those are pill treatments you ingest, not the liquid that goes on the nail. I'm currently on month 2 of a pill, and yes you have to get your liver checked each month (it's a three month once-a-day pill) but so far, my liver is still fine. My doctor told me that if you start with a perfectly healthy liver, it's pretty uncommon for it to SERIOUSLY fuck you up.  EDIT: Though you also aren't really supposed to drink alcohol/take things with acetaminophen in them because that's basically doubling up on your liver and that CAN hurt it. 
c8cwflx	1	0	Only internal treatment I've read has this effect, not topical.
c8csz3o	1	0	You can also get a pill prescribed from a doctor that works faster. A popular liquid medication is [Funginix](http://funginix.com/) (it used to be called Fungisil)
c8cu77n	1	0	That shit is really bad for your liver though 
c8cuwuq	2	0	I took the pill for 6 months to cure toenail fungus a few years back. I couldn't drink alcohol and had to get blood drawn every two months to check my liver. 
c8cvl1u	2	0	I did it when I was 12 and all but one pinky toe is cured. I should do it again, but I love alcohol and my liver too much.
c8cr8d8	11	7	Wouldn't you like to know, FIST_ANUS_TENDERLY ?
c8cup1i	2	0	didn't read the name, thanks for pointing it out! (it's all about the little things)
c8cu4j0	2	1	My brother had it really bad and nothing worked. Then. He started soaking his nail in vinegar everyday and finally cured it. 
c8cw2ph	1	0	apply tea tree oil, very effective, got good feedback from all my clients (I'm a herbalist shop owner)
c8crgei	2	1	One way: cut thumb off
c8crl5o	5	1	That's surgery
c8cs0nq	1	0	Sounds like a nasty case of apotemnophilia to me.

c8cuik5	1	0	Time to go find an armadillo
c8cu1wp	2	1	I had fungus on most of my toenails. My doctor prescribed Terbinafine. A 90 day supply cost $10 at Walmart. I took it for the 90 days and my toenail fungus that I had for years is gone.
c8crg6v	5	1	OP takes fungus nail, turns it into photogenic nail. Good job OP.
c8cpi0z	11	2	As someone who's struggling to get the bloody fungus from my big toe-nail... yes! Glad it can be done.
c8cr9j9	5	0	From a natural treatment standpoint, piss that fungus off--they love warmth, moisture, and darkness, so trim that nail back as far as you can and stop sleeping with your nasty socks on.  Get that nail some sun.  For the others, unless you're diabetic, nail fungus is essentially solely cosmetic.  DO NOT use the pills, like Lamisil/Sporonox.  They have potential to melt your liver and then you look kinda silly for worrying about a little fungus among us.  Source: I've seen livers melt from drugs
c8craz3	2	0	I had the same problem. Soak your feet in vinegar and warm water. Seriously. Google it. Cleared it right up after doing it a few times a week for a couple of months.
c8cu6c8	2	0	Vicks VapoRub actually works. It takes months to grow out though.  I've gotten rid of it in several smaller toes, still working on the big toe.  Lately I've been putting it on once a week (like on the weekend) when I have time to take a shower, wait for them to dry out, apply it to toenails, put on some socks so I don't get the vicks everywhere. It probably would be better to do it daily.
c8cpnga	31	8	Get some better nail clippers, the jagged edges offend me.
c8cpomd	145	19	I'm not replacing my teeth.
c8cr4vy	16	5	[/r/redditlaqueristas](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditlaqueristas) would like to have a talk with you...

c8cu2y4	1	1	But then calling you "Gummy Joe" makes no sense.
c8d0071	1	0	Don't you love these random little tangents reddit takes us all on?  I just realized I was reading about a stranger's nail fungus for like 20 minutes.
c8csa5r	3	0	Nice recovery.  Can't help but notice nearly every time a redditor posts a pic with finger or toe nails they look jacked up.

c8cs8iz	2	0	Athlete's foot mostly.
c8coci0	30	1	I see a trend with fortune cookies trying to be like taco bell sauce packs.
c8crcqb	9	1	I got a fortune cookie a few years back that basically sai. "Disregard your next fortune".  So I asked the the lady at the counter if I could have another fortune cookie so I could disregard it.  They told me no. :( 
c8csoyj	12	1	What a bitch.
c8cwf0r	1	0	I swear I got one that said 'Eat more Chinese food'.
c8coas5	33	2	... in bed

c8cuxw3	1	0	Can you explain what you think us "idiots" aren't getting (preferably without using the word "whoosh")? Looks like you've spelled it out pretty clearly here, and it's still just the stupid shit we thought it was.

c8cpvfv	14	2	What's going on with your nail?
c8cpfnh	24	4	I saw one once that said, "Please Help! I'm being held hostage in a chinese bakery!"  
c8crjjq	23	3	But you have to wonder if that was actually a joke....
c8cro7y	6	0	It tis but a tribute.
c8cte3q	1	0	Couldnt remember the greatest fortune in the world..
c8cpx04	5	0	At least it isn't "Bad luck and extreme misfortune will infest your pathetic soul for all eternity." 
c8cqsl5	1	4	"Misfortune" creates a paradox. Because then this fortune is wrong, but if it's wrong then there is no misfortune, thus making it right.
c8cro06	5	0	They usually are not fortunes, more like advice cookies. This is an anthropomorphism cookie!
c8cqsyr	4	0	I got this one several years ago.  I remember because I am still bitter about it
c8crabg	4	0	Dat thumbnail.  
c8cr2fc	3	0	Fortune cookies always piss me off. I always get proverbs like "a penny saved is a penny earned" in mine. Seriously, what the hell?! This is a FORTUNE cookie, not a PROVERB cookie. Get your shit together, China!
c8crfpv	3	0	I found this in a cookie as well! And submitted it to reddit. Earned me a grand total of 4 karma. Maybe my title wasn't very clever, or I was still kinda new.   EDIT: Forgot to [link to it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zcprs/how_fortunate_for_that_piece_of_paper/).

c8cq2ve	1	0	Tis a prophecy
c8cq8oq	1	0	or is it?
c8cqi1l	2	0	Maybe it's some kind of genie fortune. You've let it out of the cookie and now have three wishes.
c8cqk8o	1	0	I kept that exact "fortune" in my wallet for years.  Always got a laugh when I showed it to folks.    Obviously I should have posted it :)
c8cqs11	1	0	I have one too! hooray for these "fortunes"!
c8cqu2p	1	0	It may not be a fortune for you.. but for that fortune, this is quite fortunate :)
c8cqzvi	1	0	I once got a fortune cookie that said "blessed are the children for they shall inherit the national debt". I don't think that's a fortune either.
c8cr2xm	1	0	I've come to grant you 3 wishes!
c8cr3n7	1	0	That paper seems to be a bit thick for being from a fortune cookie.
c8cr4ma	1	0	Well the fortune seems to find it rather fortunate.
c8cr9cv	1	0	Don't feel bad, last time I ate Chinese (about a week ago) my cookie had no paper in it at all.  Guess it was saying I have no future.
c8crua8	1	0	I had one of those a while back as well. mentioned to the cashier that my cookie had no fortune, got a free one, that one had two in it.
c8crely	2	0	One time I got one that just said "You will have a party".  Seemed more like a command than a fortune...
c8critc	1	0	When you get an awkward thank-you note from a long dead genie? 
c8crivk	1	1	Check around the house maybe there is a Ginny hanging around!
c8crlqp	1	1	I don't know why I found this quite so funny, but I laughed out loud so loudly my five year old asked if I was ok. The weird fortune I got was "You aspire to be a Viking." Oddly enough I have random Norse/Viking heritage. 
c8crola	1	1	I got one once that was a sentence fragment - it said, "Behind a good man, there are always."
c8crpnb	1	1	This is a Taco Bell sauce packet. 
c8cru7b	1	1	Silly fortune cookie, you're not a Taco Bell sauce packet.
c8crwme	1	1	Maybe "cookie" symbolizes OP's mortal shell. RIP TheRealBoyardee.

Again no one wants to hear you bitch and complain about how you didn't think a certain post was funny... Or whether or not you've seen the post before. Really, no one gives a shit. 
c8ctz61	54	11	Also false: it wasn't the self-pic that aired on the news, but a picture of him taking the picture.  Why must you turn Reddit into a house of lies?
c8csc11	39	22	Here's a link to the interview from this morning: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57568546/john-mayer-his-shadow-days-are-over/  watch at 5:35
c8d0ep7	1	0	John Mayer at Grammy's or Edward Scissorhands? http://i.imgur.com/s7lMBcl.jpg
c8cr4qb	282	54	Seven years ago was... 2006?  Holy fuck.
c8crgkm	226	47	Gross
c8cxzq8	19	5	[Even grosser](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21636030.jpg)
c8cy0x5	17	3	I don't get it...
c8cztkm	3	0	I wish someone could explain that picture to me. 
c8crdbp	55	18	Whoa. That is kinda hard to believe. :(
c8crhb7	36	11	When January 1st happened last month, I thought about how long ago all the years were. 2006 being 7 and 1997 being 16 were the strangest for me. 
c8cuy8y	20	4	I remember when Jurassic Park hit theaters. That was nearly 20 years ago.   Good lord I'm depressed now.
c8cvkjx	10	0	The 00-10 flip fucked us for 10 years.    Edit: 11 years. 
c8cvznu	5	0	Toy Story came out nearly 18 years ago.
c8d0cy9	1	0	You shut you whore mouth
c8cttwg	18	5	The 90's are never coming back. :'(
c8cuokt	31	6	2090s?
c8cuv43	19	2	Sounds like they're coming back to me!
c8cvdz0	8	0	Hopefully with improved hairstyles.
c8cvvkq	7	0	I bet the Rachel will be badass in the 2090's
c8ctcxu	2	5	How is it?
c8ct0ux	15	5	The Matrix Reloaded came out 10 years (decade) ago. Oh wait.. That movie was never made. 
c8ct985	17	2	I can't see what you said it was blacked out. 
c8csogh	36	17	Had to go to my first FB photo album to dig this up. 
c8cu8g2	4	0	Think of what you were doing in 2006, and who you were. If it doesn't seem like there are a good stock of memories and a decent amount of change from then to now, then weep about your miserable existence and start now.
c8ctrqi	6	1	There was me, thinking I will have a long life and suddenly time started speeding up tenfold after 2000...
c8cx6dt	1	0	I'm 19 and I still can't believe that 1994 was truly 19 years ago. I don't even remember anything before the year 2000.
c8cychu	2	0	This...this...life is too quick. 29 now. Each passing month feels like it is flying. I cannot imagine being 50 or 60. I wonder if time seems to pass faster each year from here until I die. I hope not. I really try to appreciate every minute I have.
c8cuwdy	2	0	Kids born the year I graduated are in school now. Sweet Jesus.
c8crdyd	55	11	Why did it make the news?  I'm curious!
c8cs7xk	32	9	They profiled him because he had to have surgery on his vocal chords and hasn't been able to sing due to it.  Though he is recovering and should be back soon.
c8cu390	6	0	Also, Sunday Morning on CBS, it's not really "the news" as much as kind of an AM version of 60 Minutes.
c8cvsye	3	0	It's kind of like the AOL homepage, but this time everything is a video.
c8crklw	48	34	They did a segment on John Mayer this morning for some reason on CBS. 
c8crlxe	115	20	I knew all those facts from that picture...
c8ctx9f	6	0	I feel like i have a better understanding of literally everything in the universe now.
c8csj4o	79	12	John Mayer is the worst. He's a ridiculously talented guitar player. He bags all the hottest chicks. And he actually seems like a cool and funny dude. I hate his fucking guts.
c8cuyde	17	7	He's actually been known to be a real asshole to some people if that makes you feel better.
c8cw38d	11	5	lol @ how often Reddit cries "hearsay" and "where's the source" on stuff that disagrees with them but then when something flimsly agrees with Reddit they don't bother. Even when it's unsourced hearsay  
c8cxn6o	2	0	Source?
c8cxr5e	3	0	[Every fucking reddit thread](www dot reddit dot com)
c8cxp83	1	0	It was a solid interview (the one OP is referring to was on CBS Sunday Morning today). He essentially said he had been an asshole in the past. 
c8cw46b	3	0	Go back to your fancy cars, and your big bank accounts, and your celebrity friends, and your beautiful women ...and Victoria Silvstedt, Playmate of the Year..
c8czlnx	1	0	According to his interviews he has a lot of trouble getting laid and can only bang blonde white chicks due to his "David Duke dick"
c8crcpd	187	58	That's cool, not awkward.  Just because you are a redditor doesn't mean *everything you do* has to be awkward... or does it?
c8crh0o	145	77	It was awkward seeing my past self on tv this morning without my knowing it was going to happen!
c8crulc	233	38	That's called a surprise.
c8cszqx	71	13	Maybe she was in the middle of telling someone that she has never seen John Mayer in person. 
c8ct6oi	29	6	You are correct. That would be awkward.
c8cw1r9	4	1	Don't even act like I've been outside of a filming of the Today Show before. And who the fuck is John Mayer?
c8cs8tb	26	16	No matter what situation it is, it's ok to feel awkward. OP, that shit would be weird to me as well. Wait, weird by definition is not awkward. But feeling awkward is wierd sometimes... or maybe all of the time...I have no idea what I'm doing... [8]
c8cvzbx	1	0	Both "weird" and "awkward" are relative concepts. Example: it would be weird for John Mayer to have a "normal" relationship. And awkward too. 
c8ct8xe	4	6	No, awkward is bad. It's your brain struggling to find a way to deal with a bad situation. It's usually caused by someone, usually the person feeling the awkwardness, making a bad mistake. This is not okay to feel, and, biologically, I'd imagine we're programmed to avoid those situations. The only way I'd see this as being awkward is if she's lost a lot of weight since then, or had a bad acne problem, or was just finishing up telling her friend how much she hates John Mayer, or something unlikely such as that.  Edit: Actually, that WOULD be kinda creepy now that I think about it. I'd imagine some people's reaction would be awkward. I can understand now.
c8ct4fy	16	11	I don't think she knows what awkward means...
c8cs2ua	17	13	Not every emotion needs to be connected with awkwardness, but who the fuck am I to say whether or not it was awkward for you? Fuuuck it.
c8curv6	5	3	Why is that awkward. I swear people just say shit because everyone else does. 
c8csd72	4	2	Do you know why they are only airing it now?
c8csjvt	22	14	He is about to go back on tour after having surgery and not singing for 2 years so they interviewed him. No idea why or how they used that picture though
c8css2d	17	26	So you admit that it's not funny.
c8csyqh	27	21	No I had a pretty good laugh at it
c8ct64v	25	42	I didn't.
c8cwiiv	1	0	It's a good thing nobody gives a fuck if you find it funny. If you don't find it funny, down vote or ignore and move along. 
c8csd20	61	60	You guys about done?
c8cuodt	15	9	You're a Redditor, and you posted a picture, and now you're annoyed that people are being critical? You had to have expected this.
c8cuq4k	22	25	I've just never posted anything claiming it to be awkward before. Don't feel like defending myself. 
c8cwtb2	3	1	I'm not going to downvote you because I understand, but it becomes as simple as not replying to them. Chances are, the opinions of the users of Reddit will not have a lasting impact on your life or reputation. Just stop answering them :-)
c8cw079	2	1	I'm a redditor because everything I do is awkward.

c8csb6i	17	1	Pan?
c8csnv0	16	1	I think I can help with this Pan/Pam situation. There's 2 m's? Pamm.
c8cw56u	1	0	Guys, guys... it's Afghanistanannies. 
c8ct6u8	8	1	Are you saying Pand?
c8cuh09	11	9	I worked in a bakery once with some elderly women who called me pan for a while. 
c8cvoeb	2	1	Did we just become best friends?!
c8cvsqd	9	7	Do you wanna go to karate in the garage?
c8cxrz2	1	0	YUP!
c8cu62u	7	3	That awkward moment when..So Awkward^Awkward^Awkward^Awkward^Awkward^Awkward
c8cshol	38	17	Why is this "awkward"?
c8csp9a	56	48	Because it felt uncomfortable to suddenly see my past self on television unexpectedly
c8ct3g6	34	18	so you post it on reddit for everyone to see?
c8ct8e4	89	38	Glad you're keeping up. 
c8curm4	8	3	How'd you get so *smooth*?
c8cz061	1	0	FAIL.  Smooth is by Rob Thomas.

c8csl5l	30	8	Acca-awkward
c8csqan	16	8	Acca-believe it.
c8ct1ai	2	2	Thank you for the correction. I couldn't remember which it was. My bad. 
c8ct5v3	10	6	Where is the funny?
c8ctqyw	27	13	Dude that's so awkward. I can't even wrap my head around how awkward that is. How did you ever recover from such an awkward moment?
c8cuhnu	22	16	I put it on reddit and had people confirm how strange and awkward it must have been to see my past self on television! Thanks for asking!
c8cy990	1	0	Awkwarrrddd
c8csrs9	10	6	How is this funny?
c8cog3d	2	1	[deleted]
c8col6c	5	3	I think you mean "pamtastic!"
c8crjg6	2	1	Why was the picture on CBS Sunday news?
c8crl3c	18	19	There was a segment on John Mayer this morning
c8crphf	2	1	what is that little ceramic sculpture on the TV stand of the people huddling around? I have the exact same one! is it rare? or did our grandparents just buy it at the same chain store 30 years ago?
c8cs0jp	2	1	Here's the interview: http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50140744n  And no, her picture's not photoshopped.
c8csjpr	2	1	Do you like your sound bar? Recommend? 
c8cumng	3	1	Can we please stop saying "that awkward moment..."? My brother uses it as every status update, usually with a hash tag.  I want o blow my brains out because of it. 
c8cuob7	2	1	I envy you like no other. I'm only a little bit gay for Mayer. Just a little..
c8csnxq	20	14	"That awkward moment when..."  oh shut up. 
c8cuhej	6	3	Seriously. So sick of "That awkward moment", "STAY CALM", and every other way people can't think of how to start their own sentence.
c8crno1	14	8	At least you're a cutie and look fine though, I'd be mortified if a candid photo of mine landed on television, I'm too self conscious. 
c8crq9j	18	2	Hahaha your name is poop balls.. I want to see a picture of you so bad
c8csx76	9	2	I've narrowed it down.  Either   This: [poop balls](http://cache.deadspin.com/assets/images/11/2011/09/lol.jpg)  or this: [poop balls](http://www.hopperhome.com/Poop1.JPG)  But probably this: [poop balls](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ll0bf2eTCH1qczpgv.jpg)
c8cwu32	3	0	A lot of effort for a comment that won't get many views. Good one on you.

c8ctnsc	2	1	Dingle Berries gone wild. I don't think I want to see that.
c8cstzf	3	3	10/10 would bang
c8cr3g0	11	9	I'm jealous beyond all belief, John mayer touched you. 
c8crycc	14	4	John Mayer would probably tell you to leave his tour bus after he busts a nut on your face. 
c8cs1zu	12	1	*John Mayer and Taylor Swift: The True Breakup Story*
c8cz4f3	1	0	and i would be ok with that. i mean, im not a slut but i mean; john mayer.
c8cs2bq	2	1	John Mayer gets around. 
c8cz4o5	1	0	not to me he hasnt. :(
c8crzjo	14	12	At the time, I felt the same! I got a drumstick too (in my hand in the picture) and JJ the drummer signed it. I may or may not have it in a case of concert sticks I've caught. 
c8cz50g	1	1	you are so lucky. lol
c8d0cga	1	0	&gt;you are so lucky. lol  Is this fucking facebook?
c8csj4e	4	5	Why is this guy a ladies man anyways? He seems somewhat a scumbag and he just looks....dirty. I guess it is mainly his music...  Not that I am not somewhat jealous of the amount of poon he gets.
c8cukab	5	1	I don't understand the scumbag reputation, I've been a fan for a long time. Continuum is an amazing album, newest is really good too.  I don't get why the world is so hard up on him because he talked a bit about his sexual exploits. If we weren't so prudish it wouldn't be a big deal i suppose.
c8csbvn	13	10	Here's a link to the interview from this morning: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3445_162-57568546/john-mayer-his-shadow-days-are-over/  watch at 5:35
c8csrqf	1	1	What is that on his arm? Looks like a Magic card
c8cu6lm	1	0	Isn't it a picture of someone taking a self-pic?
c8cuhsp	1	0	I totally saw you this morning. 
c8cum7z	2	0	That's copyright infringement. You can sue. Go on, go over to CNN and say what you need to say.
c8cuo1d	2	1	Why is that awkward
c8cuq8i	1	0	His hair looks great!
c8cuvds	1	0	Awkward, heck! I loved his interview today, good pic. 
c8cuzmc	1	0	this whole comment section is super intense
c8cuzuw	2	0	I'm sorry but this isn't funny. Wrong subreddit.
c8cvifn	2	0	False. That's not even close to being awkward.
c8cw511	1	0	xpost'd to r/Hey_Look_At_Me
c8cwwtd	1	0	John Mayer ate my cousins ex-girlfriends butt because she was too young for him to legally have sex with
c8cwz1m	2	0	Besides not being awkward, at least it shouldn't be, this also a different picture. Maybe it's just me, but the title makes it sound like you handed Mayer your camera, he snapped a shot, and *that* pic was on the news.  *Regardless*, this isn't funny at all. I don't understand Reddit sometimes.
c8cxk65	1	0	Is there a subreddit for coincidences? Because as it just so happens...this isn't very funny
c8czcf8	1	0	[u want to know what I think?](http://bigassmessage.com/70329)
c8czmww	1	0	False, the image aired is a shot of John Meyer taking a picture of the two of you.  Learn perspective.
c8d0teo	1	0	Hi Pam, I have the same samsung soundbar its a hw 450 or something with the bluetooth sub. I also have a similar tv is it the ps51e6500?   Mine buzzes quite loudly and I'm having to return it because it is giving me ringing in my ears and is very annoying, my soundbar has issues with optical in and lipsync.   Have you had any of these issues? 
c8d0uze	1	0	Is it just me or did John Mayer look a bit like Edward scissor hands at the Grammys tonight?
c8cs5r1	8	6	That awkward moment when... that meme isn't funny any more.
c8ctq9u	3	3	What makes this awkward, more like surprising or faintly amusing
c8cuhjf	2	0	Your lack of grammar skills makes this awkward.
c8cuosq	1	0	You mean punctuation and grammar
c8cricm	9	11	John Mayer is my god  kinda
c8cs7ju	6	10	You're a sad person.
c8csj47	8	6	Why is that sad? John Mayer is a phenomenal musician. 
c8csq2m	2	2	You look like he just impregnanted you
c8cu088	3	1	I was in the TRL audience when Mariah Carey showed up randomly back in 2001. It happened just days before she had a complete mental break down with the failure of the movie Glitter. Now whenever E! does their True Hollywood Story on her, they show a clip of her showing up at TRL... and there I am cheering in the background... I had no idea who she was. Just a very short and top heaven person as far as I knew. She gave me a popsicle and a tee shirt I never wore.
c8cu5za	1	0	I thought she was 5 foot 10
c8cu8vp	2	0	Maybe... One boob was the size of my head, so maybe her proportions just threw me off.
c8crwk4	3	5	I didn't know who John Mayer is and I was looking for the other guy in the photo. I thought OP was John Mayer.
c8crcc1	2	3	Where did the orange sun thing go?
c8crg3c	13	12	Orange sun is CBS news icon. The picture we took was on the today show for NBC. 
c8cv6hf	1	0	Agh makes sense. I'm English we don't have that here :)
c8csarh	2	3	He must have one crazy long wrist, if that is in fact a self picture on the news.
c8csc7i	3	1	Looks like the older woman is fantasizing about him
c8ctcfh	8	7	I always thought her expression was great in this picture. 
c8csiox	1	2	So say we all.
c8csl6a	2	2	Hey that was back when he was good.
c8csrhr	1	2	john mayer should change his name to john congressman 
c8ct0yh	2	1	Does he have an iPod tattooed on his arm?
c8ctcmu	6	6	Pretty sure it's a cassette tape. 
c8cth6f	3	1	You're both wrong. He tattooed the squares in order to confine all the tattoo work he wants to that one area. He said he's too addicted to tattoos and knows he would be covered if he didn't limit himself. Obviously that didn't work too well and know he has two full sleeves.   source: the link is broken. the interview should be here: http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=722  but his wikipedia page talks about it a little  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer
c8ct3yu	1	1	Fuck You John Mayer! ~ Kevin Nealy 
c8ctfea	2	1	It's not the self-pic that airs on CBS. It's the video of the moment he took the pic.
c8cth1c	2	1	I love watching CBS Sunday Morning, that's really neat :)
c8co1na	599	68	You are obviously seeing what is the stuffed animal equivalent of prison rape. That poor giraffe...

c8cpjyp	13	3	I don't see how the monkey can be so relaxed around all the violence.
c8crgx7	3	0	He's paying.
c8cqkx3	3	1	Can not under that, nor do I want to
c8cqxe8	4	1	awesome!

c8cpiit	4	1	Doesn't look like a skill game. did you just buy it?
c8cq6zz	11	0	They animals were easy to grab but the moment the claw jerked to move towards the drop chute it would release. Inch by inch
c8cqzoo	10	1	Those bastard machines always do that. "Got it. Got it. Got it... Don't got it." It's like they wont hold anything heavier than a paper clip unless the object is *perfectly* placed in it's grasp. 
c8cr708	11	3	Actually, they cant hold anything heavier than a paper clip until they have enough money in the cycle.
c8ctqnm	1	0	These machines are actually programmed to grip more firmly every 8 or so tries (depends on the value of the price). While there is some skill involved, it's more of a slot machine.
c8coug4	42	9	Some day, I want to design one of these machines that makes up for all the disappointment caused by the others:   You will go to put money in the machine, only to find a small basket of quarters with a sign that says "Take one."  After you get a free quarter, the game begins.  You will glance inside to see that there are surprisingly good items, and might find yourself saying, "Is there seriously a fucking ancient Greek coin in there?" or "Is that...is that a key to a Ferrari..?"   You hover the claw over the item, and press the button:  Instead of the claw doing anything, the floor inside tilts - causing every item to slide into the prize slot.  The claw then explodes into confetti.    Edit: Somehow confused graffiti with confetti
c8cp4sh	23	6	Into graffiti?  Oh no, that's dangerous!
c8cpyxc	15	2	Did you mean confetti or were you planning on painting.
c8cq3cr	35	4	Graffiti, confetti, fettucini - same thing.
c8cq7xm	8	3	You must be new the the English language.
c8cqak0	9	1	None of those words have English origins..
c8cqdop	6	2	How would you know you thought confetti and graffiti were the same thing. Edit: Typo, I now feel like hypocrite.
c8cqkaa	2	0	[deleted]
c8cr1kh	4	3	English doesn't have English origins.
c8cpexf	6	1	I swear, my brother wins every single fucking time he plays on those... It's so damned annoying! 
c8cqgba	8	2	You're Squidward and your brother is Spongebob. Close your eyes, be the crane, BE THE CRANE...
c8csupz	1	0	But....aarggnnnngg!  
c8cor9w	3	1	Reddit is home of the lurker
c8cpahe	2	1	Pshhh, I once managed to get it on the first try in a Denny's whilst playing "Why Fo We Fall?" from *The Dark Knight Rises* score. Shit was boss. 
c8cpkc2	1	1	I think it depends on the machine and whoever stocked it. I found a nice one on the other side of town that I would win things about half the time. Recently tho I saw it jam packed and couldn't grab shit out of there.
c8crq4e	1	0	A lot of these machines tend to be controlled by payout probability.  This means that someone is more likely to win a prize after a predetermined number of failed attempts. For example, assuming that a claw crane has a payout of one in ten, only after nine attempts will the claw be strong enough to hold an item.  Note that this doesn't guarantee a win as you can still miss grabbing an item even if the claw has the strength to capture and retain it.  
c8csbrh	1	0	The claw is programmed to let go until a certain amount of money has been deposited. They are more a games of chance than a game of skill.
c8csghp	1	0	If it helps, they are rigged so the claw will only successfully pick up an item for a pre-determined amount of times.   Edit for link: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QvsmTdKyIWQ
c8ctqg1	1	0	Too lazy to find a source, but these things are actually rigged to only give enough pressure to hold up the animals like every x tries.
c8cpnmk	5	2	Sure, penalize the victim.
c8cp3el	4	1	You should have saved the giraffe first. Looks like he's seen some shit.
c8cud04	2	0	Went back for the rest! Elephant started giving me the eye...
c8cq0zj	1	2	I would of gotten the rhino.
c8cpy08	12	3	The giraffe's eyes are saying "Help me... please... help me."  The elephant's eyes are saying "Walk away. Just walk away, man. This ain't yo business."
c8cppry	6	0	I was going to make a "bite the pillow" comment, but I had a dilemma with them being plush. Hmmm...

c8cvfx9	3	0	Worth noting that they didn't make condoms when the company was named Playtex and although it is a combo of "play" and "latex" it referred to the baby products they produced with latex.
c8cvlqe	2	0	Playtex makes bras, girdles, etc. Foundation garments. No pun there I think.

c8cwnti	1	1	Stupid bitch wished all the mutants would lose their powers! Then the Dark Phoenix came back and Hope would have been the carrier...
c8cts70	3	1	Pretty sure it's his girlfriend.  Wife makes it sound like he's a settled down 30-something, who would be wanting to take care of his family. Girlfriend sounds more 'hip' with the young kids, like he's right out of college, exploring the world before he begins a career.  Though, it's been years since we saw their adventures, they could have gotten married since then.
c8cqrn9	49	3	My grandparents have a Waldo book at their house that I used to be obsessed with--but there is one picture that I cannot find that dog's tail. Each time I go over and visit, I take five minutes to look for that fucking tail. It's been over twenty years now and I still haven't found it. I have spent so many hours staring at that same damn picture I practically have it memorized, but I still can't manage to spot it.  That fucking tail is the only thing I think about when anybody mentions Waldo. It haunts my waking thoughts. One day I will find it.
c8csutb	25	3	Nothing is worse than your younger sibling taking the book and circling where he was in pen, thus making the book a one time use book, and only for them.

c8cun2y	11	0	Could you post a pic of the page here? Either take a pic of it, or possible find it online? Maybe with the help of all of reddit we could find it. And then you could sleep well at night.
c8ct56z	4	0	quick, someone show him where it is, before he goes crazy!
c8cuk5t	4	0	You need to scan that picture in and post it on reddit.

c8cuzbv	2	1	I was going to say "is that Glencoe?" I stumbled onto a Harry Potter set some years back while on a bus tour with some mates in that spot. Were you near the "burn" (small stream) that is supposed to have the freshest tasting water in Scotland? Decent place to walk and breath actual clean air for a change.

c8cvann	2	1	If you come to Scotland I would say go to the countryside, go to Fife, see all the little towns like Pittenweem and St Monance. Our scenery and oceans are beautiful.   But stay away from the cities........just don't go into the cities. 
c8cvx5b	1	0	I'd rather be a lifer than a fifer. Haha nah fife is an amazing place. But like you say away from the city's and head out into the country it's amazing.

c8curd5	4	9	Lame! Your post is garbage. One stripe is hardly waldo, it's awkwardly on the shoulder, and he's not wearing his trademark beanie, if it's even waldo. You could have just said "check out this cool pic from my trip to Scotland!"

c8cro6a	66	22	Had just the opposite happen to me and my then-gf about five years ago in Lemon Grove, CA (an area just east of San Diego for those who don't know). We're both fair skinned and walked into a Denny's full of, and staffed by, as far as we could tell only Hispanics, which shouldn't really matter at all and we could care less.  Got on the list, sat there for 15 minutes, no big deal. First hispanic couple walks in, gets a table right away. Honest mistake probably, I inquire if our names are on the list, yes they are. 20 minutes in and it happens again. 30 minutes has rolled by and we're pissed, sticking it out for the sake of just getting a goddamn table. 45 minutes now, we're the only white people in the place still, no one is talking to us, looking at us, nothing.   We left after 45 minutes, received no service or real acknowledgement of our patience, it was infuriating. So we changed clothes, went downtown instead to one of our favorite places and had a nice lunch. We were seated immediately in a room full of white people where the only Hispanics were in the kitchen, it had a real Twilight Zone feel. It's a strange, sad, and fucked up society we live in.
c8cs27x	79	18	I can't believe anyone would wait any amount of time to get into a *Denny's*. 
c8csqh6	18	5	I'd like to order the gigantohumongous Grandest Slam of all Grand Slams, with two extra thick slabs of skin-on bacon; two chocolate chip pancakes with sweet dairy butter, caramel walnut maple syrup and whipped cream; 2 Jumbo eggs scrambled-whipped omelet stype with Swiss and Cheddar, green peppers, and diced Virginia ham; 2 buckets of fried lard; and 2 Blu-Ray-sized discs of sausage (turkey sausage, please, I'm on a diet).

c8ctvn3	6	0	As a Latino, sorry :-(  Edit: I also live in CA if that helps :/
c8crvj9	15	11	This happened in california? I had an older white man call me brother last night...I'm hispanic... It felt good...yet again I live in LA... Skin color don't matter to us...
c8csb2u	26	7	&gt;skin color doesn't matter to us  lol
c8czh1g	1	0	The LAPD would like to talk to you
c8czaei	2	0	It's infuriating how little anti-white racism is ever brought to anyone's attention.  Black/Hispanic/etc. people can marginalize white people all day and no one says shit, but an honest mistake happens to a minority and it's OHSHITOHFUCK RACISM MOTHER FUCKER!
c8czk3u	1	0	I think that racism is still very prevalent in American society, and even when overt / covert racism isn't present the fallout from past racism is still very apparent.  That's the only time I've been discriminated against, but I still count myself lucky, being a well-off caucasian in America. I've only had to deal with this once in my life so far, not for my entire life.
c8css0t	4	1	And here I thought the joke was that the service at Denny's was universally terrible.
c8cre6m	30	2	Oh...I thought that was a black girl. The round things next to his head looked like a Leia style haircut.
c8crgq9	21	3	They aren't? If that's a guy why don't the other two have eyelashes?
c8crin5	15	1	I'm fairly certain that's supposed to be a girl also.
c8cuvmv	4	0	Good eye. I didn't see the eyelashes &amp; thought those ponytails were crash pads.   "No black person would go back in time to 1953."

c8crfux	51	7	Sort of related. The Black population has a higher incidence of maxillary midline diastema (5.5%) compared to the White population (3.4%) and people of Chinese descent (1.7%). Maxillary midline diastemas (gap in between your upper front teeth) are really common in some African populations.

c8cvmmo	3	0	Yeah, woo, me too. Go gap tooth allele!   Also, fun fact, gap tooted individuals were thought to be particularly amorous back in the day. 
c8ctt1i	7	0	chances are that these children do not have gaps but are rather missing teeth as they are around the age when baby teeth would be falling out, which would be my guess, and the fact the white kid has all his is probably just a coincidence the original artist will never be able to live down.
c8cu2js	4	0	Agreed. The girl's gap is pretty narrow, which is the only reason I was reminded of this.
c8cq6ja	1009	274	They're kids. Kids lose teeth. Stop artificially inserting racism in to things.
c8cqpqp	225	99	I think OP was making a joke about the sign, not saying Denny's is racist.
c8crlog	83	10	Isn't he talking about how they have lost teeth? This post has nothing to do with the Denny's sign
c8crsut	42	43	I kind of took it as mocking what some people consider racist.  Lets play a game.  Name anything made by a human being, and I can turn it into something that is racist or offensive.  We can play to 10.  If you name a thing I can't be "offended by" you get  4 points.  If I can claim its racist, I get 2 points.  If I can only be generally offended, 1 point.
c8crvni	19	6	A black baby.
c8crxex	36	14	Why did you have to pick a BLACK baby?  What?  Asian babies aren't *cute* enough for your racist ass?  
c8cs593	16	7	I thought you were going to turn the thing I said into something that is racially offensive. Not what I said into something that is racially offensive. But I do think you have a good point here.

c8cs13z	8	2	A spoon.
c8cs4mk	15	9	You first world scum.  I bet that your spoons are used primarily by WHITE people.  What black people aren't good enough for your spoons?  Why?  Are you afraid that if you invite them into your house they'll steal your TV?    Racist.  And don't give me that racist "I have loads of black friends" line that all racists give to prove "they're not racist" you racist.
c8csa6r	20	4	Honestly, this one is kind of week. Let me have a go:  Spoon? Trigger warning that you shitlord! You know full well "spooning" is a term that sexual people use. I'm asexual and that word triggers me!  There's also the obvious the classist implications. "spoon" calls to mind "silver spoon" as in, "that disgusting SAWCISKERM was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He should be sent to the camps"
c8csbpy	7	5	That was good... But still only 1 point.  It's 2 points if you can be outraged by the racism of spoons.
c8cszoc	3	1	So you're saying racism is worse than other kinds of discrimination? 
c8csf8m	12	4	Go to any store and see if you can find even one black spoon. Checkmate you racist shitlord.
c8csmbh	8	3	Oh I bet you just ASSUME all the spoons there are white.  You fucking SAWGASM neckbeard.  I also hate body shaming more than white men, but neckbeard isn't body shaming because men have no shame!

c8cs4wp	8	2	None of this made any sense, lol. Saying that my spoons are used primarily by white people isn't racist if it's a fact.
c8cs8m8	6	1	Well played you sneaky devil 
c8cs9am	18	6	Your racism literally makes you a rape apologist.

c8cu1c2	5	2	[AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND](http://www.reddit.com/r/nocontext/comments/189m2s/your_racism_literally_makes_you_a_rape_apologist/) off to /r/nocontext you go............
c8cshzq	4	2	&gt;What black people aren't good enough for your spoons? Why? Are you afraid that if you invite them into your house they'll steal your TV?   Its not the TV I'm worried about the blacks stealing. Its the spoons! 
c8csv90	4	2	Spoon??? Man, what a white tool. Don't you know CHOPSTICKS are the only right eating utensil?
c8cy7ft	1	0	Implying that a spoon (western) is more worthy of bringing up than a pair of chopsticks (eastern).  Racist!
c8cu56d	1	1	A cloud. A fluffy, harmless cloud.
c8cv3vq	1	0	Ok, I'll go!  I'm black and I have to wait for a table at Denny's while white families are seated without wait.
c8cwk7k	1	0	A snowman, a blackboard, erm... Can't think of anything else at the moment. 
c8cwr52	1	1	Oh, and I bet all the snowmen you've ever made were **white**, you racist!  And a **black**board?  Why would you even say that?!  It's the "African American" board if it's anything!  It's not even *black* it's green!  What- is it a *black*board because black students are more likely punished with it by standing in front of the ***black***board writing, "I'm sorry, white teacher- I'll be less colored next time!" a thousand times?!  God DAMN it you're racist.
c8cx9ni	1	1	It's ok we call them chalk boards now.  We are not allowed to say black board, but I'd have been equality happy with a white board. 
c8cxaxi	1	1	As for snowmen, I think I'd have to quote Henry Ford on that one. 
c8cxdfn	1	1	You... you gonna share that quote?  I bet it's some racist quote anyway...
c8cxep0	2	1	You can have it in any colour as long as it's black.  Same applies to the snowman. 
c8cykxa	1	0	I am scared to say paper so I will go with Hair. Hair is made by human beings, our bodies, everyone has hair.
c8d0hpo	1	0	* Paper  And what is the default *color* of paper?!  **WHITE**.  Fucking, racist paper...  &gt; Everyone has hair  [OH, **EVERYONE** HAS HAIR](https://www.google.com/search?q=alopecia&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=TGMYUfC9GtDI0AHxzYHADQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=989&amp;sei=TWMYUe3jMKTg0QHljYGoBg#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=complete+alopecia&amp;oq=complete+alopecia&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i24.4372.5075.2.5225.8.8.0.0.0.2.104.521.7j1.8.0...0.0...1c.1.2.img.5SJvP6BrHhY&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.42080656,d.dmQ&amp;fp=6e2d7ab55cb6565a&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=989).  So people with alopecia aren't human beings?!  You.  Fucking.  Racist.  Also- you "make" hair just like you beat your heart.  It's kind of going against the spirit of the game.  It's not actively made, it's on par with saying flowers or trees.  Doesn't stop you from being racist though...
c8d0ojk	1	0	Hair has nothing to do with race. Alopecia does not attack by race.
c8cryme	12	2	Let's be clear, Denny's *was* racist. They got into a lawsuit because some of the restaurants wouldn't accept black patrons or would make them pay for their food before receiving it. Now they're one of the best companies for minorities and for diversity, which sort of makes the phenomenon of minorities freaking out and fighting in Dennys and throwing shit around counterproductive.    
c8csknn	8	9	Still, I know OP is joking, but this type of 'ironic' racism is just one of the reasons why *actual* racism exists. It needs to stop..... but it won't
c8csxi4	6	6	This. " funny " racism honestly bothers me a lot more
c8croz2	33	27	What's the probability that the latin and black kids would be portrayed as missing teeth, and the white kid would have perfect teeth, entirely by accident! Be honest with yourselves.
c8cs0q6	20	2	You think he's latin just because he's a little brown, don't you? Don't you?
c8cs2e4	7	0	If two of three kids have uniform probability of missing teeth then the probability that the two non white kids missing teeth is 1/3. BUT, a uniform distribution probably isnt appropriate to apply here since artists rarely do anything just randomly. 
c8crzi3	38	9	1/3?
c8csv8b	15	2	Pedantic analysis: 1/3 assumes one and only one kid has perfect teeth.  A more realistic assumption might be to assume a 50% probability of perfect teeth for each kid.  In that case, there's a 1 in 8 chance that the white kid is the only one with perfect teeth.
c8csqsb	10	4	Let's try it like this...  What's the probability that the latin and black kids would be portrayed as having perfect vision, and the white kid would have lack of vision, entirely by accident! Be honest with yourselves.
c8cqwd2	18	17	My thoughts exactly.
c8d0c55	1	0	TIL colored people loose teeth, just like crackers. 
c8cqle8	8	1	Only Bill Gates has dental plans.
c8crxmv	5	1	The black girl has a gap in her teeth, and the Hispanic/Phillipino kid is a boxer and lost a tooth in the ring.
c8crcov	20	3	How the fuck can this be racist?  Perhaps kids lose teeth, and the one kid hasn't lost one yet.  Or, maybe he's lost a bottom tooth and you can't see it.
c8cubc9	5	0	They appear to be children. Maybe they lost teeth?  nahh, it must be racist somehow.
c8cqyn6	16	4	or optometrists?
c8cr726	13	5	Agreed.  Chances are the other two also need some vision correction but sadly, cannot afford it. 
c8ctfty	3	1	I only wish I had dental care. I had half a tooth break and fall out this last monday and I have no money to get it fixed, let alone a dentist I see regularly. Aaah, being white and poor is annoying. All the stereotypes, none of the benefits.
c8cq0xb	8	3	Why are the displays on the right side upside down?
c8csmw5	1	0	First thing I noticed as well. Would make piloting that time-machine pretty difficult.  Also - why is the clock spinning backwards? The painter of the picture can't be inside the machine, observing the outside world...
c8csqs6	2	0	Because kids made a cardboard time machine.

c8crg5t	3	0	that white kid doesnt look drunk or high enough to be at Denny's.

c8csxu2	2	1	No its the fact that minorities parents beat them.
c8ctnjj	3	0	I was at denny's recently and the front of their specials menu on the table depicted two father/son pairs. One was white and looked very rich, the other was mexican and looked quite trashy (and insane).
c8cu18z	3	0	Also, only white people are white.

c8cu619	2	2	I had a Pomeranian as a kid; I named him Simba because he reminded me of a lion. He was cooler than a lion would have been, but he also had the horrible habit of shitting everywhere. It was okay though because then he'd just look at you in an adorable way and you couldn't stay mad at him and you'd say "oh simba you're such a silly dog stop shitting everywhere though please" and he'd just go off and do dog things.

c8csv5c	39	7	I like this sign better than most of their other tactics though. It's not calling for people to ban abortion, just asking people to not abort because they believe it's a person.   I really only have a problem with pro-lifers when they're hateful or try to legally deny abortion options. 
c8ctd8o	14	4	&gt;I like this sign better than most of their other tactics though. It's not calling for people to ban abortion,  But that is the purpose of this tactic. Not just to dissuade people from getting an abortion, but to influence the public's perception of abortion to that of "murder" and thuse influence public policy regarding it.   
c8cv2gj	5	1	It's to do both.  Yes, they don't want the babies to die but they also want it to be illegal.
c8cyqep	2	1	Babies? What babies? FETUSES. 
c8czk0w	2	0	Call them whatever the fuck you want.
c8ct90k	57	25	I prefer the term "Anti-Choice" because that is a more accurate description of their agenda.
c8ctqny	25	5	Yes, but this billboard doesn't force that agenda down their throat by accusing them of baby killing.  Rather it respectfully displays their position on the child being alive.  As someone who is pro-choice, I hate being labeled as pro-abortion, since I know all my pro-choice friends who have had children considered their babies living beings from the second they were conceived.  Yet they all still support a woman's choice not to be legally forced to act as a child incubator for 9 months.  So I have no problem with people trying to spread their view on when life begins, as long as in doing so they don't actively block a woman's right to not have her bodily resources forcibly coopted by another living being for 38 weeks or so of their life. 
c8cunde	19	8	You prefer the term anti-choice because it sounds worse and you're pro-choice. Pro-lifers aren't thinking 'Fuck women being able to decide their own fate, lets get rid of abortions'.   They're anti abortion because they consider a foetus to be alive, and the abortion to be murder. It's an ethical concern rather than the pure, vicious and pointless bigotry that a lot of redditors seem to make it out to be.  
c8cx5wv	2	1	Praise jebus.   Amen.
c8cvu13	10	5	it's still more accurate than pro life. the argument is about the ability to choose to have an abortion. they are against that ability to choose and therefore anti choice. pro life is unfairly sugar coating it in the same way anti life would be unfairly demonizing it.    edit: fixed spelling mistake
c8cwo39	5	1	You say the issue is about choice, they say the issue is about the right to life.  "Anti-choice" has nothing to do with the viewpoint of those who consider life to begin at conception.  In their terms, when the issue is murder choice doesn't play into it.
c8cyred	2	1	Unless they're against war, capital punishment, and the like, then they are *not* "pro-life," period. 
c8d08yx	2	0	That's just a strawman argument that adds nothing.
c8cz1c0	2	1	I'm opposed to capital punishment and spoke in opposition of the invasion of Iraq... do I get to call myself pro-life?  But, seriously, arguing over what supporters call themselves will never persuade those supporters.
c8cx8vi	2	1	but the root of the argument is still about the ability to make the choice to have an abortion performed... any ethical discussion about the abortion itself is separate from the ability to choose to have it done.  they are still against the ability for that choice to be made, regardless of their ethical viewpoint on it, that to me is more logically categorized as against choice or anti-choice.
c8cyz48	2	2	You are simply demonstrating the impasse quite nicely.  The root of the argument for pro-lifers is life — there can be *no* "ethical" discussion about ending a life.  I get that you don't see the logic, but that's why it's an impasse.
c8d0txc	1	0	Just a note: obviously the fetus is *alive*.  Living doesn't imply anything about the living thing's rights, of course.  Bacteria are alive.
c8cxhsv	2	1	&gt;Anti Choice  2edgy4me
c8ctqry	18	9	So, in response to a comment applauding one side for not being obnoxious about their beliefs and ways, you decide to be obnoxious about yours? What a win!
c8cuaxx	20	22	I prefer the term Pro-Death to Pro-Choice. But that's just me.
c8cvp5z	7	2	...implying that people who support access to legal abortions in fact prefer abortions to preventative measures?  Interesting side note, nations who have laws protecting abortion access actually have lower death rates for women seeking said services. Conversely, nations who's laws restrict abortion access tend to have more women dying from unsafe abortion procedures. So who's really "pro-death"?
c8cun82	13	14	Yes, that is in fact just you.
c8cw2xy	2	1	Anti-choice would be if the message of the billboard mentioned something to do with the *legal right* to an abortion.
c8ct6bm	20	8	Newsflash: They *all* are for legally denied abortion. 
c8ctmwv	7	7	Newsflash: There's always a discrepancy within a large group, so not *all* are for legally denied abortion.
c8cuqf2	8	1	So then they would be pro....choice?  Huh
c8cwiiw	1	1	Like I've said before, *everybody* is pro-life. Some people choose to say "Hey, I don't agree with your decision to abort, but I won't let my opinino stop you!" while others choose to say "Hey, I don't agree with your decision to abort, and I'm going to save that fetus's life by not letting you have an abortion!"  But no one thinks abortions are 100% a *good* thing.
c8cyrsc	3	0	&gt;But no one thinks abortions are 100% a good thing.   I do. I absolutely do. 
c8cwxml	3	1	"Hey, I don't agree with your decision to abort, but I won't let my opinino stop you!" is pro-choice.
c8cx016	2	0	Correct
c8cucux	6	4	Since "most of their other tactics" includes things like them shouting "I love you mommy, don't kill me!" at any and all women walking into a clinic, that's a pretty low standard you've set.  EDIT s/p CowFu's reply: the low standard is "like this sign better than most of their other tactics."  That's grading on a curve right there.
c8cuiw2	5	0	How is my standard low? Yelling at women walking into a clinic is clearly hateful and something I have a problem with.
c8cupb3	1	0	Edited my comment to clarify that.
c8ct6ui	5	6	What about all the people who have already had abortions and might feel terrible after a constant barrage of billboards like this?
c8cud4h	11	7	It's almost as if they don't really care about women...
c8cu2by	10	3	Seriously just curious here, but why isn't adoption considered as a solution to this? I am not well read on this subject, it just seems to be a nice happy medium. The teenage girl can still visit if she desires, she doesn't have to have the whispers of being a "murderer" going around by bigots, and a family thys ready gets a baby.
c8cub3j	18	6	Adoption is an alternative to parenthood, not to pregnancy.  Carrying a pregnancy to term is a large stress, and even in young, healthy people it carries a risk of permanent disability or death.  Many people feel comfortable with an abortion due to their position on when life begins, but do not feel comfortable with the idea of adopting away a child once they have given birth.  Also, my understanding of the state of adoption in the US is that it leaves much to be desired -- it's not like there are droves of happy homes out there willing to take any child.
c8cutw3	2	0	As someone who adopted 2 kids out of fostercare and assists in adoption training,  you are right and wrong.  We have more than enough parents who want to adopt kiddos here in the us.  The only children we can't get adopted are deviants (teens with a past) and the mentally handicapped. only 10% of foster children 'age' out of the system.   As for abortion,  I have no real comment.  
c8cy2n2	1	0	Cheers.  I know a lot more about abortion than I do about adoption.  I should fix that, but that won't happen this week.
c8cybg7	1	0	There are wait lists in most states for newborns.  Parents sit on them for an average of a year and a half.  This does vary by reigion, but I'm speaking of the national average.  The south has significantly less wait times, but this is because the teen pregnancy rate is significantly higher than in the north west.  It is also attributed to less oversight and red tape for adoption families.  (This obviously can be a good and/or bad thing).   I'll link you to the Texas Department of Child Protection Service and Family Planning when I get home.  They have reports with all these statistics.   
c8cz5xa	1	1	Cheers!  Stuff on, say, abuse rates in adoptive homes (or some other metric of adoptive home quality, like subsequent drop-out rate of adopted kids) would also be useful, for the question of, "would my adopted kid go to a good home?"
c8cu5ei	13	5	Because the adoption system in America is fucked up. It's a terrible system that does not give unwanted children a sense of security. The real solution to the abortion debate is widely available birth control. But guess who opposes that and spends money to prevent BC from getting to where it needs to go in order to prevent abortion in the first place? That's right, pro-life orgs. 
c8cvd82	1	1	That's because, unlike environment-raping SUVs, condoms go against God's will. Yay, logic.
c8cuagm	3	1	At any Heath department they will only make you may as much as you can afford for birth control. If you can't afford it, it's free. Well, at least around here.
c8cu9en	7	3	Adoption is an alternative to parenting, not to pregnancy. If someone doesn't wish to be pregnant, adoption does nothing for them.  Nine months of unwanted misery is not a situation where finding a "happy medium" is suitable.
c8csy1q	27	17	An abortion is difficult to live with, but not near as difficult as having to feed and take care of a spudling on a 12k job. These billboards piss me off so much. It's like saying "Its ok you've fucked up! Let everyone else pay for it! Hurray the almighty and powerful word of GOD! Merica!" Fucking knuckle draggers...
c8ctcdz	31	10	&gt;An abortion is difficult to live with,  That's very subjective.
c8ctis7	23	5	I'm not sure why you're being downvoted.  Many women carry no baggage at all from their abortions and it's unfair to insist that they should.  It just reinforces the stereotype that an abortion is always a devastating and life-ruining procedure, and promotes the idea that any woman who doesn't lose sleep over a zygote is an uncaring and heartless bitch.
c8cu2df	7	3	I do agree with you. It should not be insisted upon women that they *should* feel any way at all. However, something that you both forgot to mention was hormones. A lot of times it is emotionally stressful for the woman whether she likes it or not. Her body accepted the fact that it was pregnant, it started producing the chemicals and transforming into a home for a baby. When that gets abruptly terminated, the body freaks out. Causing depression, mood swings and all sorts of other instabilities. Evolution did this, we all have instinct to reproduce, even if we don't want children at this time. The same thing happens with a miscarriage. My overall point is this- it is instinct to feel loss when one cannot reproduce. Regardless of who or what terminated the pregnancy.  Edit: accidentally  a word.
c8cuwki	5	0	Being pregnant is what caused all my mood swings. I was good bit bitchier than usual too. After the abortion, all I felt was relief. I mean, after my body settled into being normal again. That and I wasn't throwing up anymore. 
c8cu80g	7	5	Feel free to post a source for all that.  In the meantime, I'm downvoting you because you're posting theory to explain a non-existent phenomenon: most people feel relief following an abortion, not mood swings and depression.
c8cvuwu	4	0	KnittyPanda said she felt relief, but only -"I mean, after my body settled into being normal again." Great! You are a perfect example.  You asked, so here are numerous sites of personal feelings and medical backings of how this could affect a woman's body and thus, mental state. I would like to clarify that I never said ALL women feel this way. I was pointing out the fact that a woman *can feel an abortion is the right option for her*, then hormones come into play and although this person still feels they made the correct choice, they still feel unexplainable mood swings and depression or loss due to hormones. I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you are a male, and that you probably have no medical background (if I am wrong, please correct me, I am more than open to such thing). I am a female, I also have worked many years in the medical field and have gone to school to learn about this subject specifically.   The reason it matters that I am female and you are (probably?) male is because I know how hormones can affect a woman's body. Shit, just birth control pills affect our hormones in such a way most men cannot understand. I would not stand there and tell you how it feels to be hit in the testicles, because I don't own testicles. Therefore I have a rough understanding, but will never truly understand what it would feel like (without some sort of surgery that I would not be willing to get just to prove a point.) But I digress..  I purposely said "A lot of times it can be emotionally stressful for a woman whether she likes it or not" I did not say every woman feels this way. Now, for you to say "**most** people feel relief following an abortion, not mood swings and depression." I'm sorry but I feel that is ignorant. You went out of your way to scold me for saying that *some women* may feel depression, meanwhile you're saying that most women wont. I'm sorry, I don't recall ever learning that hormones were a "theory to explain a non-existent phenomenon".. I don't feel this was very fair considering you stating that *most* women feel relief is your personal opinion. There is medical and scientific backing for what I said, unlike you. It is a fact that hormones do play a large role in pregnancy, abortions, and miscarriages. However, how it will affect the woman is left to the individual. I never said otherwise.      http://afterabortion.org/2002/abortion-clinical-depression-linked-in-major-study/    http://www.womanshealthoptions.com/emotional_support/mood_changes_and_depression.html  http://www.mdjunction.com/forums/post-abortion-discussions/general-support/923343-hormonal-stages-after-abortion  http://www.steadyhealth.com/Major_depression_and_grief_after_abortion__very_confused____t101478.html     &gt;Hormones are changing back to their pre-pregnancy state after an abortion. This chemical change can make a woman feel sad and emotional.  http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/12951.php
c8cxxl5	1	0	It sounds like I was responding to a tone that you didn't mean to convey.  I do concede that you wrote "a lot of times... her body."  When you subsequently wrote "the body freaks out... causing depression, mood swings..." instead of, "some women's bodies freak out," for example, you made a language shift that made me think you were saying this was a standard-issue biological response.  If you are saying that, I disagree with you.  If you're saying that hormonal activity can affect emotions, then of course I agree -- but I don't agree that it plays a significant role (i.e., tips the balance from relief to guilt, for example) in most women's experiences.  Re: your sources.  Afterabortion.org is an openly anti-choice organization. Womens' Health Options does not provide citations for their statements, except their statement that post-abortion stress syndrome is not a real phenomenon.  The MDJunction forum is one person's anecdotal experience (which is important! but not what I was getting at).  Ditto SteadyHealth.  The Medical News link also doesn't have a source.  What I was getting at, and I'm sorry for not having been more specific, was something more like this: [Emotional Response to Abortion](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J015V09N04_05), a 1990 review paper on existing research on post-abortion emotions.  Sorry for not having found a more recent one, but I've already burnt my dinner in writing this response.   Anyway, it sounds like I got a different message from your language than the one you intended (which I think was an understandable reading on my part, but that would be a discussion of semantics, not of abortion).  I'm sorry for making you feel scolded -- I'd appreciate an apology for you having said my stance was an ignorant personal opinion.  It sounds like we're on the same side here.  Re: my citations.  I am male, and have not personally had an abortion or a menstrual cycle.  I'm a med student planning on going into ob/gyn, and I've done a lot of work in the field of abortion and worked with some wonderful providers.  The need to care for conditions that I am guaranteed never to have will be a lifelong quandary for me -- but even if I were a woman, I would only be able to have my own menses and my own pregnancies; I would still rely on studies like the one I cited (and feedback from my patients) to know what most women's experiences were like.  It is important to me that you not feel trolled, flamed, or otherwise belittled by my response -- if you do feel that way, then it's a failure of communication on my part and I'd be happy to try and rephrase.
c8ctirc	18	3	I'm with you on this.  Let's stop pretending that abortions are 100% of the time an arduous decision that requires infinite sympathy and compassion. If it's done early enough, like late in the first trimester, it's about as personally sensitive as getting an abscess removed.  Having said that, it most definitely can be a very difficult thing for a woman to deal with, and all the moral and persona support in the world should be available and granted. But part of me thinks that the "difficulties" typically associated with getting an abortion are drummed up and played out by groups who want to create a certain image about abortion, namely that it's unsafe or incredibly emotionally taxing. All this in order to build support for restricting access.
c8cu6z9	7	5	Regret for abortion is increased by these signs.  Just throwing that out there.  And yes, the overwhelming emotional response that people have following an abortion is *relief*.
c8cuxb8	3	0	I don't know why you're downvoted so much. These signs definitely do increase the shitty feeling. I'm a guy, and when I saw that fucking daddy's girl one I almost had an accident. After awhile you get numbed to them and they just irk you. But its a constant reminder of what you've done. We don't go around putting up giant "Remember the crusades?!" Billboards... 
c8cuu7i	1	0	My whole comment is very subjective... Because I'm speaking from personal experience.
c8cuj9a	7	5	I'm pro-life, but I don't believe in God, or go around yelling, MERICA! I can understand your reasoning that some people may find it difficult to take care of their child. To me, this doesn't change the fact that they are still people, in the first stages of their life. So, I understand if it's gonna be hard to look after your child, but please don't kill it.
c8cv9ey	4	1	Do you really think its fair to bring a child into this world in an unstable condition? Money doesn't just magically appear when you have a child. It does the EXACT opposite. So having a kid when you can barely support and feed yourself is setting everyone up for failure and extreme stress here. Which just spirals into a hurricane of problems and leads to a dysfunctional household. Case and point. It's best to wait and have your child when you're ABLE to support him/her. Otherwise brace yourself for a tsunami shit storm. Hardly a day goes by that I think to myself having a little me running around would be the light of my life, but then I think about how many bills I can't pay. The fact that the most I can spend on food comes out to some ramen, frozen chicken and rice. Try working diapers, baby food, doctors expenses, clothes, etc etc etc into that 20$ budget... Life is great and precious and I hold it in the utmost respect. Which is why I chose (agreed) to an abortion, to give my child the life he/she deserves. 
c8cvevc	2	0	I'm pro-choice, but adoption is always an option.... 
c8cvuem	2	9	If we abort babies that would be born into hard times, then where do our heroes come from. The people who inspire others usually don't come from plush little households. And why should you punish the baby just because you can't keep your fucking legs crossed.  Edit: bring on the downvotes but if you're gonna fuck somebody, at least have enough money to support a baby.
c8cw7rf	5	3	Your logic is bad and you should feel bad. 
c8cwd2t	3	4	I don't feel bad. I hate seeing people say babies should be aborted because "it would be hard, I might have to eat ramen noodles" we'll you should have thought about it when you didn't use protection and fucked every dude in sight. And these babies could grow up to do great things. But your gonna abort them cause they might "inconvenience" you
c8cwq2t	5	1	&gt;you should have thought about it when you didn't use protection and fucked every dude in sight  Hey, as a college student in a stable, long-term, monogamous relationship who still has occasional scares that the condom broke or the pill didn't work correctly, ***fuck you*** for assuming anyone who is scared of raising a child is some kind of promiscuous whore.  I mean that sincerely. ***Fuck. You.***  And I hope that you realize that "inconvenience" would equate to "make you stop your own personal life completely to earn money to create at least a semi-suitable environment to keep a child safe and comfortable and well-fed and happy."
c8cwrc9	2	5	You made the pledge to care for the baby when you opened up your legs, I don't care wether you have to raise money, It's your responsibility 
c8cx1p0	1	0	What I don't understand is, how is having a first trimester abortion (~90% of all abortions happen here) any different from just stopping the conception from happening in the first place?  The "Plan B" pill happens after sex and is used most commonly as a "crap, I think something went wrong with the BC method we used" reassurance.  It stops conception from occurring.   So how is a fertilized egg that is but weeks old any different from an individual egg and sperm? Honest question.
c8cxfgl	2	0	No pledge is made there, buddy. What are you 15?... Where's YOUR fucking abstinence ring? Seriously, wait until you're put in a similar situation and let's all see how you fucking choose to handle it. Get the fuck off of reddit with your retarded thought process and utmost ignorance to everything. Not everything is cut and dry, black and white, plain and easy. I take it you don't have sex, maybe because your fugly as shit and have it out for everybody that does have sex, or you're still living in your fantasy little Disney world where fairy god mothers help you clean your pizza box infested room and pre marital sex sends you to an eternity of fire and brimstone. You insult the very existence of humankind. People like you are why George Bush happened. 4 TIMES! So let me take a moment to thank you for where our country's at. Glad I fought for your freedom so you can go around blind to actual life, pushing your illogical opinions on everyone. Git er dun, cowboy!  
c8cwtwy	2	0	First off, I'm a guy. My wife (at the time) and I were incorrect in our timing and presto she got pregnant. Looong ass story short, I was about to get out of the military due to fucking my leg up. We both knew there was no way we could support a child what with all the debt I've accrued thanks to uncle sams glorious salary (i was young and reckless). I was ready to accept responsibility anyway and raise this kid. She was opposed.  I respected her opinion and went with it. I wasn't about to force her to become a mom. It had to be a mutually agreed deal. Fast forward to now I'm glad with the decision because I've been in a financial rut because of my disability for over 5 years now. I hate welfare, won't go on it, I don't support it because too many idiots take advantage of it and drive everything thru the roof economically. This wasn't just a "oh, got pregnant, darn let's fuckin kill the little bastard." Decision. We talked about it a lot before jumping to abortion. Raising a kid with no money is impossible. You're risking killing said kid by mal nutrition and not being able to afford doctors appointments alone. So think really fucking hard when you say "I hate when people say it would be too hard, blah blah blah" and realize 'hard times' entails more than just personal stress, jackass.  Tl:dr - Bigcat710, shut your fucking mouth when you don't have a fucking clue what you're talking about before you even take your fist steps in your own fucked up walk of life. You fuck. 
c8ctrk9	5	2	All these damn welfare leeches using *my* tax dollars need to just stop having so many fucking kids.
c8cthah	12	11	So your argument is rational. But youre missing the point of the billboard which is to force you to confront reality...
c8cubm4	10	2	I think that the point of the billboard is to push a specific interpretation of reality, in which hiccuping is evidence of personhood.
c8cv3qu	3	5	So the only thing you take literally is the "hiccuping" part? lol. If we could do something positive it would actually be defining when it's kinda bad to abort a baby instead of either A. avoiding reality B. choosing to ruin a young life out of being afraid of going to "hell" or C. being a straight up gangster about it like the spartans were throwing babies off cliffs and shit. I don't know enough about fetal development to know when a fetus becomes more like a person than a collection of cells sometime around 20 weeks?  You might feel like being silly and say "when the baby hiccups then its a person" but at **some point** it actually does become a person.  At birth?  There's something a little irrational about that cause I've seen babby development pics and they're not just cells even a few weeks in...  Edit: What I meant to say is instead of dogma vs. dogma it'd be nice to come to an agreement so we don't just argue us vs. them forever
c8cy1ul	1	0	It's not like we're going to solve this problem in a Reddit thread, but I like to hang my hat on consciousness for the question of personhood.  Of course, it's tricky figuring out what the cut-off for level of consciousness should be, but it's only until birth that we have the compelling reason of another person's bodily autonomy to be examining the question so closely.  Conveniently, it's likely that consciousness doesn't begin until birth, as per this [very good 2010 review paper](http://www.rcog.org.uk/fetal-awareness-review-research-and-recommendations-practice).  I do dislike the "cluster of cells" argument, because it's true!  Fetuses at 20 weeks look pretty darn baby-like.  If I thought that superficial resemblance to a baby were a sufficient case for personhood, that would make me call a fetus a person.  I think we should shift the question away from "when is fetus person?" and towards, "what is it about people that makes them important to protect, and when is it the case that a fetus also has those properties?"
c8cwyr4	2	0	[Here's](http://php.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/images/e/e5/Human_Carnegie_stage_1-23.jpg) your infographic for this statement:  &gt;I don't know enough about fetal development to know when a fetus becomes more like a person than a collection of cells sometime around 20 weeks?  and this statement:  &gt;I've seen babby development pics and they're not just cells even a few weeks in...  [Here](http://www.abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/) is a great source about abortion in general. According to that source:  &gt;88-92% of all abortions happen during the first trimester, prior to the 13th week of gestation (AGI/CDC).  So if you look back at that handy image I posted, and then know that statistic that "~90% of all abortion happen before the third trimester (~12 weeks in)", you can clearly see that the vast majority of abortions happen *before most people would even be able to tell if the fetus was human or some kind of other animal.*  It's not some adorable infant being killed. Most often it is just a cluster of cells.
c8cxzdi	2	0	I appreciate your response and links.  The pic is great for reference up to about 8 weeks.  I actually paid for my GF to have an abortion when I was 18, most likely saving both of our lives from being completely wasted. I still just don't understand the vitriol with these billboards.  Like I said, abortion saved my life and I have been quite productive thanks to it so I'm not against it. Maybe I'm 'guilty'? I paid some person to vacuum a baby out of my then-GF. Point is I'd rather confront the truth and I don't think they're bad and definitely not dishonest (it says 52 days from conception on the billboard) for personifying a fetus.
c8ctie7	14	8	Lol, do you think women who get abortions don't understand what is happening? Like they are just naive lil girls who think they're stomach is getting magically deflated?
c8cto93	8	10	That why the issue is dumbed down to either "pro/anti-*choice*"?  Edit: And of course they are not just "naive little girls".  *And since they aren't*, why is there such an issue with personifying the little glob o' person to be sucked out?
c8ctqo0	7	8	Because it is. One side allows for people to make their own choices regarding whether or not they should have an abortion. The other side makes that decision for them.  
c8cuva2	1	2	I'll back you, but can I make my own decisions about whether I can own an assault rifle?  Or are you going to take it away from me for my own good?

c8cvs41	2	0	Egg on my face :-(.  Didn't realize you were making a reference. 
c8cvgnx	1	0	Mmmmmm... welfare rolls.  
c8cwfzb	1	1	I dislike that they think they are "Pro-Life" they just dont like abortions but after that those pro-lifers dont give a shit about the kids or the mum anymore it seems.
c8cwobp	3	1	The majority of pro-life orgs are not "anti abortion", and the proof is in their rhetoric. If you were anti-abortion, pro-woman, pro-child, anti-dead babies and all the other stuff they claim, then they wouldn't do the things they do; they wouldn't be against birth control or comprehensive sex ed (both help lower the abortion rate considerably). They wouldn't be against emergency contraceptive, and they wouldn't make 100% untrue claims about it being an "abortion pill"(emergency contraception prevents implantation, which is basically the same thing as a miscarriage, which happens to ~50% of all fertilized eggs). Ultimately, pro-life orgs and all their hypocritical inconsistencies end being just anti-woman; you can hear it their arguments. "Abortion is just a way around the consequences of having sex": in other words, pregnancy is punishment for having sex, which we all know women aren't supposed to engage in outside of marriage.   Pro-life BS is ultimately just anti-woman BS. Don't want an abortion? Good for you, that's perfectly okay. But why does the law need to reflect solely your opinion?
c8cwqac	2	0	You wrote that very well! :D and agreed &gt;:I
c8cu5ms	13	13	I know my pro-life opinions are frowned upon on reddit but what is so hard about putting a baby up for adoption?
c8cuagy	20	11	You've obviously never been pregnant. You've *definitely* never been through an unwanted pregnancy.  Newsflash: it sucks even when you're happy and excited to have a baby. When you aren't? Absolute hell.
c8cvve7	5	11	Nine months of hardship so your unborn baby can live sounds ok to me. Weather it's "absolute hell" or not, talk about selfish, one-dimensional motives.
c8cwfmb	4	2	Sounds okay *to you.*  Not everyone is you. Not everyone has the desire or ability to give up 9 months of their life for a child they have no interest in.  And to *me*, an abortion sounds a helluvalot less traumatizing and emotionally draining than giving birth to an unwanted child and throwing them into the adoption system. For those of us who aren't white, there aren't gobs of infertile couples waiting to snatch up our unwanted newborns. A child of color is most likely going to stay in the system until an older age, and despite all the cheesy anti-choice slogans you can throw at me, that's *not* a choice I could live with.  Edit: I wish I could find the post from /r/relationships a few days ago where this guy was talking about his girlfriend considering abortion because she's 6 months away from graduating law school. Multiple people in the legal field came in to say that going through with the pregnancy would absolutely destroy her chances of becoming a lawyer- because the field is already saturated and nobody will consider hiring a pregnant woman or new mom when there's a thousand others who can dedicate all of their time to their job, and if you don't get hired by the time there's a new batch of graduates, you've most likely lost your chance. It was a great anecdote about how not everyone has the ability to put their life on hold for 9 months.  Everyone's circumstances that lead them to choose abortion are different. It's never a black and white issue, and no one has the right to decide what is and isn't moral or even "easy" for someone else.
c8cxiym	3	3	Then don't have sex and create life. I'm sorry not everyone has the "desire or ability" to carry a child they created, but they did in fact create life. Abortion is murder. Do morality and responsibility have no place in your worldview?
c8cxssp	2	1	Murder is a legal term that has no bearing here. Perhaps you think it *should* be murder, but in most places, it isn't. I don't mean to derail, but it's just a huge pet peeve.  Morality is subjective. There are many, many gray areas, and this is one of them. You think abortion is murder? Sweet! The good news is you never, ever have to have one unless you want one. I absolutely will consider abortion if I am ever in such a situation because I know I am not capable of caring for a child or giving one up for adoption without extreme emotional trauma. *That* is personal responsibility- knowing my limits and trusting others to make the reproductive choices they know are best for them.  I don't look at pictures of aborted fetuses and feel sad or outraged, like I'm sure you do. I am more upset by pictures of famine and homelessness and abuse- things that the children of unwanted pregnancies are far more likely to experience. As I stated before, morality is not universal. You see injustice in killing the unborn, I see injustice in forcing others to bring unwanted children into the world.
c8czi1l	3	1	It must be nice to see so everything in shades of gray. Too made double standards about rights in your book. Disgusting
c8czla0	1	1	Hey, look, something I can agree with you on. It's incredible nice to be able to see the world with an open mind.
c8cyds7	2	1	It would break my body if I were to be pregnant. But I love having sex and i love being intimate with my partner. So I take precautions. Condoms, pull out, birth control, etc. I am not by any means reckless. I do indeed have "responsibility in my worldview."  Sex isn't *just* for making babies. This whole "If a woman is going to open her legs like the whore she is, she needs to face the consequences and have a baby because it's her duty!!1" mentality needs to go away. It's disrespectful. If a couple is being careful and using protection and things happen to go wrong, there doesn't need to be any consequences.  Now, I'm getting the fuck out of this thread before I have an aneurism out of fury.
c8cz9kh	1	1	I know how you feel. 
c8cw08d	10	6	Yes, I'm sure victims of rape who have abortions are entirely selfish and one-dimensional.   You fucking arsehole. 
c8cxcdp	5	3	Because rape is the major reason most women get abortions. /s
c8cvofw	3	0	I can't even respond to this because you're just so ignorant. Do you even understand what is involved in pregnancy? Do you understand the bureaucracy involved in giving up a baby for adoption? Do some preliminary research before making it all sound so easy and simple.
c8cv796	3	1	This is a valid question.  I think it's cliche to say something that sounds this dumb, but I'm pro-life and pro-choice (FFS, Romney said this and I thought he was an idiot for saying it lol).  If you have sex, you accept the risk of pregnancy, period. Saying "I would be emotionally torn to get rid of this baby, it would make me severely depressed." Ok... so, that justifies ending the potential for someone to live a life? (Cliche to bring up atheism too, but...) I'm an atheist, I believe I'm incredibly lucky to be alive considering how many people aren't alive (sperm/egg combinations are like 10 ^ ^^300000000000). It's not murder, it's a group of cells, but it IS denying the chance for someone to live...  But, it's also important that abortion is available in MANY situations. I'm just not real happy with the mentality "I can have sex with no repercussions, I'll just abort the fetus if I get pregnant." - I think that's a piss poor attitude.  Adoption is a very real solution, albeit it's not the "end all" solution, because you still have to be pregnant, go through childbirth, and be separated from it which can be devastating...  :shrug: I guess I'm all for the right to abort, I'm just not proud of how easy it is to abuse getting an abortion. There's gotta be a line between "no consequence for my actions" sex, and "if you get raped you have to have their baby", ya know?
c8cu6xb	5	2	See above.

c8cuwdj	8	11	Give me the option to be alive but hungry or starving and dead... I'll choose to starve, thank you very much. 
c8cvbd3	3	1	It's a valid point. This debate is annoying, though.
c8cvqjp	2	1	I'm pro-choice, but I get really sick and tired of the 'pro-birth' garbage.  The kid might be hungry... so he should go ahead and just die.   These are the kinds of arguments that make us look crazy to independents. 
c8cv7wc	6	6	But growing up in a foster home can be really shitty. Therefore lets kill fetuses.

c8cv3i9	2	1	God, if my SO gets pregnant and I hear hiccups 52 days after conception, I'm aborting that freak. Thanks for the heads up, billboard.

c8ctpjw	3	2	A lot of people getting abortions in the seventh month, or?
c8cvkre	2	0	Not in America, at least.   Since the Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood vs Casey are still federal law, all abortions at and/or past a little before seven months are prohibited by law (including the highly controversial partial-birth abortions) unless in case of a medical emergency that threatens the life of the mother. And usually by then they just deliver prematurely instead of aborting the baby since it's past the point of viability.   The actual laws are a lot more complicated and vary from state to state. But basically, nearly no abortions happen in the seventh, eighth or ninth month in the US.

c8cuadu	4	4	[deleted]
c8cufx9	5	1	52 days from conception, which is considered 9-10 weeks pregnant. 
c8crcnw	4	2	Can someone explain this please?
c8crk61	32	7	They're all over the highways of America, in our towns and neighborhoods, because churches want to stop abortion so bad.  Other variants are "I'm daddy's little girl!" (with a picture of a little girl who is too cute to be aborted), "it's a black and white issue" (showing a black baby and a white baby in the bathtub), and "my heart was beating ## days after conception" (with a generic baby picture).  The "I'm daddy's little girl" is especially egregious because it's tugging at the -dad's- heartstrings to get him to stop the woman from getting an abortion.  
c8cs4we	15	1	Generally they're on the border between states that have looser/tighter abortion laws, or in the area around a clinic.  When I was getting my IUD, I was going to a clinic I'd never been to before in a bigger city. I was like "shit shit shitshitshit I'm going to miss my appointment--" and then I started seeing those billboards so I knew I had to be getting close. :D
c8csrjh	5	1	Here in Minnesota they're all over the place, middle of the state, edges, everywhere -- I travel for work sometimes, and they're all over South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin, too.  That doesn't count the handmade 4x8 sheet of plywood nailed to a fence anti-choice signs, or the "you have another option" billboards for "crisis pregnancy" clinics (which are all about getting that baby born and not about 'choices').   Apparently women's uteruses are the only way billboard companies stay in business around here.
c8crxjb	3	1	21 days. Yeah, I've seen them too. 
c8cs20p	6	0	Fucking Florida man, went to Miami once and I shit you not that sign was repeated every 300 feet for 50 miles.
c8creq9	21	7	Because something can get hiccups means it shouldn't be aborted according to prolife
c8ct11x	5	2	It's an attempt to humanize the fetus, since they view it as a living thing that shouldn't be killed.    I'm not saying they're my views, so people reading this please don't try to argue with me.
c8crk40	3	3	Is this true though? what an odd reflex to have when you neither breather nor eat...
c8cro7t	7	1	I've read it's speculated that it helps strengthen the diaphragm for breathing.
c8csrc0	4	0	I thought in utero hiccups didn't happen until the third trimester, and are seen as a sign of lung development. ?
c8ctgm1	2	0	Usually sometime early in the 2nd, though you can't feel it until the 3rd. I could feel both my little guys hiccup at around 30 weeks or so- and they did it ALL the time.  Edited to add: looks like they have been observed as early as 8 weeks? A little earlier than I thought.
c8cthcp	2	0	yeah, I think their claim of "52 days past conception" is a little loose. does anyone know?
c8ctl4s	2	0	I'm not really sure what a reflex has to do with "sentience" though- I'm more concerned with pinning down where in the grey area between tissue-blob and viable, reactive critter a line should be drawn (barring more extreme medical issues, health of the mother, etc- which are a separate category to me. I'm talking of "birth control" abortion).
c8cuf2z	1	0	This seems a lot more plausible than any purpose hiccups could serve in adults.
c8cry2u	4	0	Yes, it's true. My son did and still gets hiccups all the time. It's an odd feeling, at first like a kick but develops a pattern. 
c8cuea6	1	0	Yep! When I was pregnant with my daughter she got hiccups all the time. :) They were rhythmic little spasm just like any hiccup, but coming from my belly instead of my own diaphragm.
c8ct61q	4	2	The adult movie sign below it is a nice touch. They understand their market. 
c8ctf4y	5	1	There's always some religious ad next to the porn billboards. I remember seen a big "Jesus is watching" next to "Adult videos" on 35 South in Texas and couldn't help but laugh at how they really didn't think that through.
c8cscfw	7	6	I had hiccups in the womb, and I swear there isn't a day that goes by that I don't get them. You should really abort every fetus that hiccups, it's a curse.
c8ct7gg	6	0	Every fetus has hiccups in the womb. Actually, the entire function of hiccups is to exercise and prepare the diaphragm prior to birth so that the baby can breath on its own when it's born.  The fact that some people get them in adulthood is really just a byproduct of this and serves no function.
c8ctdcf	2	1	Huh, interesting. I guess I shouldn't trust my mom's knowledge all of the time
c8ct5na	1	2	that's not hipster.. that is some kinda weird science. 
c8cx7uk	1	1	reason #12987 why I should never reproduce: If I was preggers and the baby started hiccuping or kicking a lot I would definitely smack my stomach to make it stop.

c8ctnzm	652	99	I just don't get why FIFA doesn't start suspending players for this bullshit.  Like, why don't they take any actions against these fakers and divers?
c8cu0f0	570	78	FIFA is corrupt, that is probably part of the issue.
c8cuggx	227	36	I feel like a third world country for admitting this but it's actually true. The number of scandals the FIFA have been involved in is embarassing and their refusal of video refereing is just flat out dodgy.
c8cusmn	70	17	I'd welcome video refereeing as long as it wouldn't cause games to be interrupted any way near as much as American Football is.
c8cv5gu	84	12	go look at hockey for video reffing done well. Doesnt really slow down the game, the game can continue while another ref can review the tapes / has the video box review the tapes. 
c8cvxg3	46	8	well with football you can't really just play on - the next play is crucial to whatever penalty needs to be applied
c8cui48	22	2	Exactly, Mafia run all about money. 
c8cujay	34	6	I saw an article that said that over 600 games in the past number of years were fixed. They are in business for money, not for sportsmanship.  EDIT: I don't remember the years/game ratio, but it was shocking.
c8cufkr	112	17	I've often wondered this.  You start losing playing time (see, MONEY) and you team suffers as a result, I would imagine this would happen a lot less often.    [ The Womens WC match USA vs Brazil featured one of the worst dives I have EVER seen when that Brazilian practically died on the field, got taken off in a stretcher - then miraculously got back up running after taking a good 2 minutes.

c8cukog	34	4	Its because Sepp Blatter is a petulant twat who's against the video refereeing that would end both overacting to gain a game advantage, and also see the end of fucking ridiculous disallowed goals like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WML0aP4jo_g).  The man is killing the game.
c8cvcyt	16	2	His name is Sepp Blatter?  C'mon, that's like a Disney villain name.  You're fucking with me, right?
c8cud00	35	16	Diving is an in-game punishable offense. National sports tribunals (and not FIFA or UEFA unless the game is being played under their auspices) have the power to confirm, extend, or completely negate any such punishments handed by the referee, but they can't create a ruling where there was none during the game. Many feel that this status quo is optimal, as giving the power for a game to be revisited and officiated ex post facto would change the way it is played drastically, and for the worst. 
c8cunec	23	4	Yea but why not give fine and suspension to player that fake? I feel like it's attacking the integrity in the sport...
c8cuk0d	16	5	The NHL and NFL will both fine and/or suspend players for illegal hits after the fact.  Regardless of whether or not the referees in game call anything.  It works pretty well.  The NBA also fines players for "flopping" now, which is kind of what this is.

c8cucz0	72	8	Watch it in HD. It will change your life. 
c8cuet2	43	6	It's like HD is only useful for sports.
c8cuf7p	29	4	Fuck, sports are the only reason I even have cable. 
c8cuu3a	10	1	It gets much easier with practice.  When I am watching with newbies, I always tell them:  - the players know where the puck is, so look where they are looking - most of them are skating to it, which means they are leaning toward it, so watch the angle of their bodies.   - the cameraman knows where the puck is, and is going to try and keep it in the center of the screen.  Most of them are very good at it.  And yes, HD is teh shit.  
c8cuvjm	24	3	As someone who has grown up with it (aka Canadian) I have NEVER understood this complaint.   I think the problem is when people dont understand the game well and are not able to accurately predict where the puck will be. 
c8cuc3g	77	23	Obligatory - I went to a fight once and a hockey game broke out!
c8ctz2h	86	11	This. Constant action which includes plentiful contact and scoring, and players actually get penalized if the ref thinks they were diving in an attempt to garner a whistle. 
c8cu34n	53	5	with this add in the fact that now with HD TV you can follow the puck without that glowing shit fox did in the 90s and I can see hockey becoming the second place major sport in north america, but to do that the NHL needs to pull their heads out of their asses and stop locking out the players every 4 years
c8cu8jm	43	10	If you needed that glowing shit to see the puck in the 90s, you probably shouldn't be watching hockey. 
c8cuoyw	4	0	Verbalizing the idea that the glowing puck was a good thing was enough to have your Canadian citizenship revoked and your ass deported to a third world country back then.
c8cuf3d	3	0	they're probably in their 90s.
c8cul0o	3	1	Hockey will never do well with the leadership they have now.  Bettman is the worst commissioner I've ever seen.  
c8cubd4	24	5	As someone currently watching hockey, I AGREE. 
c8cu8tv	41	8	I started watching hockey 5 years ago to replace soccer (i moved to US and didn't want to watch mls) Man best move I ever made. Go hockey
c8cun2k	6	0	JUST DON'T WATCH THE CANUCKS PLAYOFF RUNS THE LAST TWO YEARS.
c8cupd4	19	3	[Hockey is the toughest sport there is and Americans still don't like it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plQDmYqeUQs)
c8cusn5	3	0	Okay I have to admit it. I  have been watching hockey a lot lately with my Canadian friend. I freaking love it. But a few of the games, they break to commercials once the fighting starts. What the heck?!
c8cvr0e	3	0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO-Z3wPlZF0  Toughest. Sport. I've ever seen. People who play with the most heart of anyone I've ever seen.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Ui1LhEqqnC8#t=21s  Toughest fighting/most intensive fighting I've seen in a sport that doesn't center around said fighting.    This leaves out checking people through the glass, heavy hits at 20+ MPH, taking slap shots at 100+ MPH [(this is the aftermath of taking a slap shot to a body part)](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17lahm6nkowuajpg/medium.jpg). Players yanking out their own teeth, playing with broken legs, broken wrists, etc., and refusing medical treatment just to help their team. 
c8cufgn	62	13	Baseball is a great game, but I've found that most people who haven't played it don't appreciate it. 
c8cutum	14	0	I played baseball through high school and agree that it's a much more interesting game than it's given credit for.  That said, I can't watch a whole lot of games.  I usually just watch rivalry games.  Then again I'm a Met fan, so it might be harder to watch for me than others.
c8culyi	5	0	I think it's like that for a lot of sports, or activities in general. I can watch a baseball game now and again myself and enjoy it. But I couldn't watch it every week with any type of devotion.
c8cuohi	8	2	The same could be said for soccer in the US.
c8ct7ty	116	43	Soccer goals average at about 2 per game. Also, have you ever watched golf?
c8ct9fg	153	12	Hours and hours of televised sky...
c8cuaer	52	4	I worked as a camera man for a golf game once. Half the time we couldn't see the balls on the sky so we just kind of guessed where they were. At least one of us ended up being right.
c8cuq12	21	1	I always wondered how the cameraman menaged to follow the ball, thanks for answering that
c8cus0w	14	0	It depends on where we are standing in relation to the ball. If it is crossing our camera, it is hard to keep up with, but if we are near the golfer aiming down the green, we can catch them pretty easily provided it is a clear day. Any clouds or fog make it almost guess work, as most of our monitors for the cameras are Black and White.
c8cueur	9	2	I think that's what makes soccer exciting, personally.  I grew up a huge American football fan, and still am, but 5 or 6 years ago a friend got me into watching the English Premier League.  Then came the world cup and that amazing [game winning goal by Landon Donovan.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-qTJoWsmEI)  Since then I've started watching soccer even more.  That moment is probably my all-time favorite in my history of watching sports.  And I'm a Cowboy fan who watched them win 3 Super Bowls.  To explain why I feel like low scoring makes soccer exciting, it's because it means every goal counts that much more.  So the buildup to each shot-on-goal is that much more exciting, whether there's a score or not.  The only time soccer gets extremely boring is when a team is up like 3-0 and goes into defensive mode.  Then it just looks like a tennis player practicing against a wall.
c8ctf9y	70	55	Soccer games can be as boring as any other sport, sure. But there is more action going on in general than either baseball or football, there is no way around that.  As for golf: yes - at least I've tried. It's horribly slow, but that does not make football or baseball any faster or more action-packed.   Different things for different people.
c8cubdi	32	14	Don't forget the other big-4 sport: basketball has the same fake shit that soccer does.
c8cuj51	19	4	But they're fining players that do that now. Granted they don't fine the star players, but they just started the rule this year. 
c8cv448	6	0	They fine people in soccer too. Nearly every week in the Premiership. It doesn't do anything, they get paid too much to care. 
c8cv5bb	3	0	In the NBA after I believe 5 fines you get suspended. 
c8cv2hj	3	0	http://gifsoup.com/view7/3187704/jerome-simpson-flop-o.gif
c8ct5ux	71	36	The study done showed the ball was only in play an average of 12 and a half minutes for both Baseball and American Football.
c8cu1wj	103	27	Well, and Anthony Hopkins only has, what, 16 or 17 minutes of screentime in Silence of the Lambs.  Sports all rely on suspense to maintain people's interest, the way they build suspense is always different.  Joggers are in constant "action" but it's no fun to watch.
c8cuihp	32	6	Exactly. Some of the best baseball games are the pitching battles, or the potential no-hitters. Nothing is happening, and that's what's so entertaining: the suspense.
c8cvqqf	4	0	To say that most of the time in baseball nothing is happening just demonstrates a misunderstanding of the sport. There's action and suspense in every single pitch. Some people might not full pick up on this, but to say it doesn't exist immediately washes away any credibility they have in the subject.
c8ct73s	82	21	BEST 12 MINUTES OF MY GOD DAMNED DAY YOU LITTLE PUSSY! (I kid.) 
c8cukp7	6	2	The ball in baseball is always in play, unless it is hit into the crowd or fowled...
c8cugt4	35	22	That's not true at all. The ball is in play 30-40 mins a game in the NFL.   If you really want, I could link multiple vids to you proving this. Mainly from the NFL website, where they have condensed games ONLY showing the action. These vids last 30-40 mins. Of just action. No standing around, not commercials, no commentary. Just the action. 
c8cuqed	17	5	Yeah, I'm pretty sure the statistic was supposed to be 12 minutes out of every 60 broadcast minutes.  That would make more sense.  And even then, it seems a little steep.  That kind of ratio would probably only happen during the Super Bowl, where there's an elaborate half-time show and more commercials.
c8cvkrz	2	1	even if the number of playing time were double, say 24 out of 60 minutes it's still an atrocious amount of standing around, slow motion, some guy yelling, some guy patting someone butt and of course, commercials.   I watch 1 AMfootball every year, the superbowl. But that's just cause of the social gathering and the food, has very little to do with the game. Blackout was a nice touch, kind of made it interesting. 
c8cv0jl	9	3	The study he's referring to, if I'm not mistaken, showed that the ball was in play for about 12 minutes in a game. This sounds about right to me, but I can't really speak to their methods or the validity of their results.
c8cv7ni	2	1	[Hm, you're apparently right.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704281204575002852055561406.html)  I guess I can kind of see how that would be possible, come to think of it.  A typical play, snap-to-whistle, would last around 5 seconds on average.  And in today's game a lot of teams let the play-clock (45 seconds) run to near zero before the snap pretty often (making adjustments at the line-of-scrimmage, etc)...    Still though, that's what American football is.  It's an explosive game with multiple short bursts of energy and aggression.  Crazy to think though, only 11 or 12 minutes, I never would have imagined that and I played football through high school.
c8cul8m	3	0	But...NFL redzone  
c8csir8	162	47	Not just American males. This European female hates it too.
c8cu8xk	87	18	European male. Some of us also hate it.
c8cuaqd	47	20	European male. This is that game with the ball right?
c8cty11	101	24	Oh for fucks sake, every sport has stupid terrible downfalls.
c8cusru	35	7	But this one is correctable.  Look at the NBA, they now fine people for flopping and flops have gone down drastically.
c8cvehu	5	1	It's actually not that easy to see. I've seen a lot of fouls that were actually dives, but I've also seen plays where it looks like a dive yet the player actually got hit.   Also being hacked on your feet while running sucks.   And divers get carded and those who go down are asked to be removed from the field until the referee tells them it's okay to come back (which takes a while). 
c8cwib6	7	3	FIFA is a different type of organisation than the NBA, they govern in a completely different way. They can't simply hand out fines and suspensions because they're not the ones running the tournaments. The English FA are responsible for suspending players in the Premier League, the French FA in Ligue Un, Uefa in the Champions League etc etc. The problem lies in the fact that many countries have different opinions on diving. In Spain, Italy, Portugal and South America it is considered to be a completely legitimate method of play and if you can gain an advantage for your team fair enough. I'm not saying I agree with that, but it is impossible for FIFA to implement a wide ranging rule with so much opposition from the FAs of so many different nations. The American Major Leagues run in a completely different way and are pretty much independent from the international federation of their sports (see the MLS previously had any drawn ('ties' for our American friends) games going to penalties) and can pretty much do what they want.
c8cuuzn	19	11	I say this as an American male soccer fan, it is 1000 times worse in soccer than other sports
c8cub2y	18	2	[Some](http://youtu.be/I0gS5CshUDE) people don't dive in football. And it can be actually quite fun to watch when people play the game how you're supposed to. 
c8cufl9	9	2	Now, see, that guy is worth watching.
c8cvm7h	2	1	Does he have hands? Wtb messi as a slot receiver. 
c8cubkv	19	3	There is too much money involved, too much at stake for players to not do this.  However the English Premier league is getting much better, usually a foreign player will turn up and dive for a bit but then the media and the managers destroy him.  For every diving, cheating player, there is also one that takes kicks to the faces, plays through injuries and will throw his face in front of the ball, EG, Jamie Carragher, John Terry, and Vidic to name a few.
c8cw4uf	6	0	Most people who use this excuse for not liking soccer have never really watched it to be honest. You're right the EPL has gotten a lot better because of the way the fans/media treat divers. 
c8ctbqb	152	51	Is it because my fellow americans always bring up diving and it's unbearableness in regards to a sport they don't watch or know anything about? 
c8cwhk2	5	2	As an American, I watched and played soccer all of my life. I know the sport very well. Its still number 4 on my list of sports behind hockey, football, and baseball.   I find diving unbearable. I find "fair play" to be detestable in the way it is implemented in the current game. I'm not talking about the fair play initiative put out by FIFA, I'm talking about players kicking the ball out when a player is injured, and the team with the throw in post-injury giving the ball back.   You want to stop teams from diving against you, and faking injuries late in the game? You say fuck it, and play on until the ref tells you to stop (which should only be head injuries and obvious signs of injury such as blood spurts or broken limbs). But teams don't do this because of some sort of fake chivalry. Its fake, because if it was real, you wouldn't be diving, and every team dives at one point or another in a soccer game. 
c8cu8qf	15	2	FYI, it's got nothing to do with being American.
c8ct5g5	243	90	I hate this too but I guess its better than NFL where a tackle is instantly followed by 50 commercials 
c8cucjs	75	13	But without commercials we can't afford to pay quarterbacks 20 million a year :(
c8cuo5c	60	18	Funny how Soccer players can earn about that and we dont have to slap an advert on every 2minutes. 
c8cuv6l	90	67	Yeah, you just have to stare at the adverts on their jerseys the whole damn game.  EDIT: Holy shit you people are easily offended. All I did was point out a fact that both do what they have to do to earn revenue. You couldn't have commercial breaks during Soccer because of the nature of the sport so of course the revenue is generated elsewhere.
c8cuya4	54	33	Yeah, having all those branded balls and shoes in nfl must really distract you from the play.
c8cv55k	33	17	There's a big difference between a Nike check and a walking billboard. I'm just saying, both sports are about revenue, they just obtain it differently.
c8cvaaf	30	19	Oh no! Please don't make me look at a small advert on a player's shirt! How unbearable!
c8ctz26	44	12	ITT: People getting all their knowledge of a sport from youtube clips.  Redditors talking about something they don't know shit about. What a surprise!
c8cub4j	31	9	As an American male I love soccer
c8cwlmq	6	0	Me too, I've played and watched it my entire life. One thing I've learned is you can't force Americans to come to the realization how boring and drawn out our national sports are. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who doesn't like soccer is perfectly entitled to that but 99% of the people who are passing judgement have no idea what the fuck they are talking about. The real crime is the American sports media who almost refuses to acknowledge the growth in popularity of the sport and blatantly spread negative stereotypes at the opportunity. . 
c8cztp2	3	0	Don't forget the fact that we don't really care for sports that we aren't the best at. 
c8cr8iv	38	12	Yes, they prefer ice hockey and football.
c8crj6r	73	16	It is just called hockey, well in Canada at least. I think there is a law if you say ice hockey legally anyone can kick you in the junk. 
c8cryre	21	2	In Belgium there are three types of hockey: ice, field and indoors. With field hockey being the most popular one. 
c8cs21q	41	15	Correct.  One of those is the best sport that's ever been invented and is the perfect mixture of speed, power, talent and intelligence.  The other is a great way to hold you over until hockey season starts.
c8ctl91	72	28	Hurr durr so the 3 or 4 minutes per 90 minute game of someone pretending to be hurt makes the game unwatchable? What about the 10 minutes or so during a football game they're actually playing vs the 3 hours of commercials, old guys talking, and beyonce?
c8ct4ll	167	81	Because of the running right? American males can't stand the running?
c8cu0db	144	59	It's the fact the gif didn't end halfway through for an advert and hot dog break.
c8cthbz	71	35	youd rather watch 7 hours of Coke ads than Italians pretending to fall over sometimes? I think its funny to be honest
c8cvgrk	4	0	No guys, you've got it all wrong. [There's a perfectly reasonable explanation for why this happens.](http://lolsnaps.com/upload_pic/1729.gif)
c8ctfgt	41	18	yeah, who cares what american males think about actual football?
c8crnwu	281	157	Implying the NBA isn't just as bad.  "Oh my gosh I fell from my normal standing height. I think I tore my ACL. I'm going to writhe around on the court floor now. I'm a grown, muscular, tatted up, street-thug-looking 27 year old black man but the pain is just too much to bear!" I mean really, you think they do that when they stumble on the sidewalk?
c8csqxa	148	23	A free throw in a basketball game has a lot less chance of changing the outcome than a penalty kick in a soccer game. 
c8ct8z3	50	3	And a lot of times it's not even a free throw, it's just a turnover. 
c8cuvvm	29	6	and stern instituted warnings and fines for players who are caught flopping. The NBA definitely isn't "just as bad"
c8ctgjd	16	10	well most of the time you dont get penalty kicks, did the refs even stop the game for this, probably not.     for a penalty kick the foul has to be near the goal, this wasnt
c8ctn6k	36	5	Kaka (guy in the Brazil jersey if you're not aware) got a second yellow card for this and was ejected from the game and missed the next match. Yep. Total bullshit
c8ct2j5	39	7	And an NBA player can't fake an injury and writhe around on the ground while the clock continues to run if his team is winning. 
c8ctxsp	8	1	Rules are changing where diving can be a technical. Has soccer done anything similar. (Legitimate question cause I have no idea) 
c8cuhar	7	1	Yes, a player can be cautioned (yellow card) and an indirect free kick awarded for Unsporting Behaviour, which includes faking injury. I've refereed for years and wouldn't hesitate to do so.  
c8ct64y	38	22	You have to remember too that it was the international players in the NBA that started the whole flop "epidemic". Divac, Mutombo, Parker, and Ginobli are known for having the best flops in league history and the USA players had to adapt to it. If you cant beat them join them.
c8cud26	13	1	USA! USA! USA!
c8cvbra	10	2	This isn't true. Bill Laimbeer and John Stockton were professional flop artists like 10-15 years before any of these international players made it to the NBA. Flopping is a venerable institution in the NBA/Basketball in general. Source: I'm old.
c8cs70w	93	69	I challenge you to find clips of NBA flops nearly as dramatic or ridiculous as any soccer flop that can be found in less than five seconds on YouTube. 
c8csar2	117	14	Chris Bosh's "elbow to the face". http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhn3LJum3mg . I hate soccer but that was a pretty brutal flop.
c8csddh	13	2	The ref's face in the background :O
c8cto7q	3	0	Oh man this is a flop and a half, thanks for this!
c8csrk0	64	7	Challenge accepted  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKh8Zq6zhRc

c8cv61w	6	1	and [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foCJDVTbYg) is why the rest of the world loves football.
c8cttgw	13	5	This is also why a lot of Americans can't stand the NBA.
c8cugtc	3	0	Yeah, better watch something like the nba where this doesn't happen. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKh8Zq6zhRc
c8cunov	3	0	Every time someone posts something similar under a similar title, I wonder whether OP thinks that Americans are alone in their contempt for diving footballers. News flash: we aren't. No one wants to see that shit, and fans in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America think it's just as weak. An American who justifies his disdain for soccer because of the amount of flopping bitches in the game is either in denial, trying to feel superior, or, I don't know...way too "patriotic" to even begin to appreciate the sport. Why try to insert a moral element into your disinterest in something when the game itself just doesn't hold your interest?
c8cwsef	3	0	As an American I quite like soccer.
c8cy3by	3	0	Soccer/Football is my favorite sport and it sucks being an American sometimes and other Americans ask me what my fav sport is for this very reason. Stop taking dives you little bitches. ITS EMBARASSING for the the fans.
c8csuy5	56	37	I see this happening in an increasing amount across the NBA as well...probably why many Americans can't stand either basketball or soccer.  [Reference:](http://forgifs.com/gallery/d/199351-1/Basketball-dive-headshot-flop.gif?_cfgetx=img.rx:400;img.ry:300;)  edit: grammar
c8cu378	16	0	Your reference isn't even from the NBA; it was in the [Phillipines](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/22/mick-pennisi-flop-philippine-basketball-association_n_1372023.html). 
c8ctvir	27	3	This isn't an NBA game...
c8ctvox	54	8	That's a horrible reference... since it's from a European basketball game.
c8ctjgr	7	2	And yet many seem to love basketball. 
c8ctr56	6	3	It's like the NBA, but WAY more exaggerated. 
c8ctqx4	33	22	British Males too. You want a real sport, watch Rugby. It's like American football, but you don't stop every 5 seconds, don't wear armour, and go mental.
c8cunwq	14	4	I play both rugby and american football and are completely different sports. maybe you just dont understand both sports enough to compare? the "stop every 5 seconds" is because its the offensives play vs the defenses for one of the 4 downs. and the armor is because nfl players don’t just tackle, they collide. They are trying to take the other player out of the play or even game.  The average nfl lineman runs 40 yards in 5 seconds,  and weighs over 300lbs. without the "armor" nfl players would have a lifespan of about 2 games before their brains detached from spine
c8cvhvr	6	1	Rugby, a real sport? At what point today watching Ireland v England did a sport break out. It was people stamping and fighting eachother. Ironically the only points being scored came through the use of feet. I play Rugby and Football (Soccer) and Football is so much more entertaining, technically and physically taxing than Rugby.   **edit** For the record, I'm not saying Rugby isn't a 'real' sport. I'm saying the notion that any sport can be more 'real' than another is really pretentious. 
c8ctty8	11	6	Happens in basketball all the time. Can't dismiss a sport because some people are idiots and try and get a foul called. There is great talent in soccer.

c8crf7s	16	4	It probably is to some degree but who cares when you've got such lovable douchey friends to take care of you when you pass out drunk!
c8csrcs	14	2	Who says they're drunk? I've had friends take off my pants and put chicken bouillon cubes in my ear when I was just napping. 
c8ctcdb	8	2	You have awesome friends. 
c8cu7yc	5	4	Who says? I do, because in all probability they are. I'm going to go with the most likely explanation here, not a multitude of less likely possibilities.  Who says they're drunk, or even just napping? They could be dead. Or maybe it's not a real person and its just an dummy. Actually, it might even be photoshopped. Or maybe, I'm actually high on LSD and just imagining this whooooolllleee thing.

c8cuefg	3	2	&gt;Honest, yes, but not undiluted.. Their reactions are influenced by their upbringing and culture.   You are correct!  My point should of been more along the lines of compared to adults they are not influenced as heavily by their culture. Since it's had less time to solidify in their base character. 
c8cukr6	2	1	Hmm, that's debatable.. Something psychologists may have studied already!    Maybe I'll look up something about this when I get back to home.

c8cvnw1	21	5	Redditor for 23 hours and you've been busy...   I approve.
c8czert	2	0	Is there a particular reason that all your posts are bullet points? Or is visual organization just how you roll?
c8d0wza	1	0	I think it's supposed to represent a list.  So his posts would read like:   "ThingsThatArentFunny [karma][timeStamp][moreKarma]   * Sexualizing children   * Not funny thing X   * Not funny thing Y"
c8cwuot	10	14	Have you added yourself to your list?
c8cvr87	13	28	you know what else is not funny, your account
c8cwfhz	12	20	I disagree. Sexualization is such a ridiculous idea. The idea of sexualizing children is amusing for its dark absurdity.  Sexual attraction to children is disturbing, however.
c8cujn5	32	15	Ugh, redditors.
c8cwn6h	6	16	I know, right? It's terrible when a Redditor intentionally misinterprets a comment and doesn't admit that it's mocking the idea that they are claiming it is agreeing with.
c8cxgl1	6	5	Sadly, that's not really the case.
c8cxqpx	3	2	If you were agreeing with the sentiment of that post, you should have added a "Yeah." It's pretty unclear if you're agreeing or disagreeing.
c8cxz4e	3	2	Also, if you weren't agreeing, you just missed the sarcasm. It's a typical sarcastic phrase, and highly exaggerated.
c8cqhs4	44	18	I want to make some lewd humor, but I'm afraid it will be crossing some line.

c8csf1u	5	0	Just heard that while watching diary of a wimpy kid 'dog days' with my little brother. The context it was use in: Rowley had lied to Greg and insisted that he, Rowley, was untrustworthy, and thus unfriendworthy. He stated how he had "crossed the line of friendship" and he was so far over it that it was no longer a line, it was now a dot. My brother explained to me how that's what our relationship was.

c8cwhhy	4	3	Really? Your example is a meta comment about line-crossing? Damn, he really did not have a point then.
c8cwyyi	5	4	Saying a child is dtf is not excusable in any context. It's still shitposting even if you are being ironic.
c8cxeq8	2	8	Let's break this extremely manipulative post down:  1. "A child" - popular phrasing signal for "Time to have sympathy now." This is so typical, hackneyed, and transparent that I can't believe you're actually using it. This is some TV news shit.  2. excusable - assuming there is something to be excused in the first place without any kind of evaluation.  3. shitposting - insulting posts rather than assessing them.  4. ironic - that post was not ironic, but you're trying to draw a comparison to hipsters.  5. Your entire post is assertion with no reason or justification.  So, what your post amounts to is a bunch of irrational appeal to try to steer yourself and others from actually thinking about the issue. That makes sense, because that's what most meaningless accusations of offense are about: people being desperately afraid, without reason, of not appearing offensive, and out of their fear trying to bring everyone else into the exact same state. If people actually thought about it, they'd also have less of a chance of agreeing with you (fear is more general than intellectual agreement, especially when you are wrong or don't even try to understand something), and you're on some kind of power trip.  What I'm going to say to you is again, the post is what it is, it means what it means, and it's only a meta point about line crossing. You can't change it, no matter what manipulative assertions you provide. It's not pro-pedophilia, and it is not an immoral thing to say, even if it is somewhat unpalatable to read.  Of course, you also delegitimize actual claims of offensive material by basically lying/crying wolf, and acting completely inappropriately in the meanwhile.

c8czhy5	1	0	I'm not using my respectable acount, so I'll be frank. You're rude.
c8czm94	1	0	So, someone can be as nasty, dishonest, and manipulative as they want, but when I point it out for what it is, I'm being rude? Are you saying that those terms I used are rude?  I was about to say that maybe there is a better way of putting it, but no, there really is not. Maybe I did not have to say they were being dishonest (that might not be accurate). However, it's perfectly fair and true to say that they were being manipulative and nasty.
c8cxq85	3	0	You are a cunt. You are lucky I am using my respectable account or else I would describe your personality further and, trust me, it is thoroughly unpleasant.  
c8cxsxh	1	5	lol. As if you really have anything unpleasant to say that isn't utter bullshit and easily dismissed. You are already saying "describe your personality," which indicates an utterly pitiful understanding. At most, you're going to make me think that you're an ignorant asshole who knows how to use harsh words. (also known as any angry schmuck in the entire world. Hell, even if you were pretty insightful, all it would boil down to is your rage)  Props for understanding that cunt is a word people can use, though.  Edit: Not to mention that I fairly called out a blatantly manipulative and nasty post. I don't quite get why you are so angry.

c8ct8ld	42	27	I feel bad for the kids looking shocked/disgusted. It's kinda a cute picture and all, but it says a lot about what we teach young children about about relationships and physical affection. Especially for little girls. There is a lot of hypocrisy and shame there. First their taught that kind of expression is not OK for them to do. Then a few years later when they start to naturally get curious, they'll either be shunned by their peers or family for their desire for self expression or, oppositely be condemned for "not putting out" in some fashion. This will likely continue until into their adult life.  Don't feel bad for her parents. Feel happy for her for being able to see something for what it is; very special. 
c8cuqba	27	13	get over yourself here. Most kids find kissing and the opposite gender gross, that's normal. Not like they are being oppressed here or something.
c8cw8h0	3	1	COOTIES!
c8ctz0b	9	4	it isn't special, its normal
c8cx2h9	2	1	A lot of kids are also shy, embarrassed, or think particular individuals are gross.
c8cv0b6	4	7	Don't mind those other comments, you're absolutely right.   Its the first thing I could think about looking at this picture; Its cute and all for sure but its cute because we find their impressionability funny. Aside from that, I see no reason for children to be disgusted and shocked by this behavior other than what society has bestowed on them. The double standard and confusion instilled on young girls is put right on a pedestal here.
c8ctapf	8	5	Yeah, so bad when girls enjoy kissing and stuff. What whores
c8ctlrq	3	2	When the top comment of Redditors reflects the top comment of Imgurians, you know shit has gotten bad here.  It's also nice that OP used the same link as 2 weeks ago.

c8csufl	7	3	Freud would say that the one who has no problem looking has merely grown up with less narcissistic parents who have felt less of a need to idealize a part of themselves by idealizing their child and so have repressed less of her sexuality. Of course Freud also said that all boys think their dads want to cut of their penises so... he's probably crazy.
c8cuxmr	8	3	Freud was also incredibly wrong about the majority of what he said. Almost none of his original theories are taken seriously in modern psychology. He was a pioneer, in that he was one of the first to take a scientific approach to human behavior. However, the very thing that made him famous held him back. He was new on an unknown field, essentially stumbling around in the dark.   So while he was wrong on so many things, he's famous for at least asking the questions, not so much for the incorrect answers he provided.   Edit: accidented a word
c8cw237	3	0	In psychology*.  If you're going to study literature between Freud's appearance and, I don't know, the 1980's, you need to be familiar with Freud's work.  It was massively influential and coloured pretty much everything written during that time period.  And some of his theories are just natural fits for literature anyway - dream analysis, anyone?  (That being said, it's still pretty ridiculous if you think it has any sort of relevance to real people.)

c8csqlu	2	0	Well that just made this thread depressing.
c8crbgx	6	5	Granted, these are just Sand Tigers and relatively harmless creatures but as a diver I'd still like to say *"Don't touch the fucking sharks, you fuckwad"*.   You don't fuck around with marine life, ever. Especially large predators. Regardless of how docile they are they *can* get pissed off and if they do, they will kill you. Even if it doesn't get angry at you, you're still disturbing it in its natural habitat which will eventually cause them to seek other places of rest with fewer diving truckers to annoy them.  Until sharks start coming to you at night, randomly high-fiving you in your sleep, don't do it to them.  EDIT: Plenty of angry truckers with no argument.

They would take it to the park and have it chase a laser pointer around for a little while back and forth to burn off some of his exuberant energy...  Fast forward a couple years, they recently just spent a couple thousand dollars on knee surgery for that dog because apparently cutting back and forth to chase the little red dot did something not good to the poor dog's knees.  I think it had 2 ACL reconstructions or something to that effect.  FYI if you have a high energy pet and think this is a good way to play with it, think again.

c8cq8am	1	0	I read that this is actually really unkind to cats.  They need to play at hunting to be happy, specially as kittens.  But they need the satisfaction of physically feeling the thing they've pounced on, preferably a toy dragged on a string attached to a little stick held by the owner, fishing rod style.  This replicates the movement of real prey.  Also avoids the cat thinking its ok to bite and scratch you the owner, as happens if you just play with your hands.  source- [think like a cat](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0143119796)

c8ct481	28	3	Common Dialogue from that show:  **Cast Member:** "We're going to Montana to interview someone who thinks they saw a bigfoot."  .  **Montana Resident:** "Well. I live in this heavily bear populated area and I saw something in the trees in the distance that I wasn't sure what it was and I snapped this extremely blurry picture."  .  **Cast Member:** "I'm convinced you've seen a bigfoot."
c8cvq15	12	2	you forgot the part where they have the fat guy walk along a ridge and swing his arms a little to confirm it was a bigfoot
c8d0fd4	1	0	Don't forget this part:  The One Reasonable Cast Member: "Well, it's hardly a conclusive sighting but there have been several in the area so it might be worth checkin-  Every Other Cast Member: ITS ABSOLUTELY BIG FOOT
c8cs4xd	55	11	Ghost Adventures as well. "Bro did you hear that!?.."Ya dude I totally heard that!".."Woah I just got really cold!"
c8cuiww	16	0	That's any ghost show ever.  Top 3 things you'll hear in every episode:  1. Did you hear that?  2. Did it get cold(er)?  3. Did you see that!?  Should be a drinking game where you take a shot when you hear someone say one of those lines.

c8cyja7	3	0	Well it's not attempted if they die. 
c8ctqrb	25	53	Their reaction is a lot more reasonable and it annoys me to see people like you claiming it's so fake and "exaggerated". I'd love to see you and two other friends lock yourselves inside and spend an entire night in the most haunted locations *on the planet* and tell me that the slightest noise or change in atmosphere won't send you "over-exaggerating" your reactions. Goodness, you people are so dense. "I'm atheist, therefor I'm halfway to being a real scientist. I've personally never experienced shit, therefor all your anecdotes are bullshit (as opposed to my lack of) , and I say ghosts are fake and anyone who 'experiences' an encounter is delusional."
c8cttu4	34	12	YE GODS! HIS BRAVERY LEVEL EXCEEDS 21 KILOSAGANS! 
c8ctx5w	17	32	To spend an hour or two alone in the most "active" room of a very haunted location is pretty brave to me. I'm sorry that tiny spiders scare you self-righteous pansies more than anything else though.  "I'm a 30 year old who works construction and loves to play Rugby, but when I see a little spider with its 8 creepy legs, I transform into a little elementary school student" - literally in every comment thread involving spiders on reddit.  I don't even feel insulted by your guys' stupidity anymore. I'm just left disappointed by it.

c8ctzlm	26	11	JESUS CHRIST ON A POGOSTICK! HE'S GONE PAST 35 KILOSAGANS! EVERYONE GET OUT OF THE ROOM! HE'S GOING TO BLOW!
c8ctzo7	4	0	Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man.  Honestly now, it's on television. Nearly everything that is on television is exaggerated to some point. It's for dramatic effect. But when you're trying to add dramatic effect to a spooky room where there is literally *nothing* happening, it looks silly.
c8cu1ds	4	0	Investigating Haunted Shit is their job, which they've been doing for about 5 years now. 5 years of being locked in haunted houses without anything to show for it should make you pretty jaded to the concept of haunting in general. But it doesn't. Because their reactions are exaggerated to provide tension for the show.

c8cs96w	19	5	I can never watch shows like that.   If bigfoot does exist i believe if they did actually find evidence it would be in the news before the episode even aired and they would be pumping the episode and dumping all their marketing into it. 
c8ctsri	9	1	That's why I don't watch the news. So if they do find Bigfoot I'll see it on the show first. That and because cartoons are more entertaining.

c8csnnb	5	1	Not *as* bad. But still pretty bad.
c8csptn	4	1	The first season was good... Then it went to shit.
c8ctdtb	4	1	At first, they really did debunk everything they could and seemed to make a real effort. Now they seem to find something everywhere. It was about as legit as a ghost hunting show could get but they're just overplaying it now and doing shit to get ratings. That is why I won't watch it anymore. 
c8ctkic	4	1	I watch Finding Bigfoot to mock and for humor. I'm a biologist so I know what they're saying is bulshit so it's hilarious to watch. 
c8ctucy	4	1	That show is were science goes to die.   The only person I have any thing resembeling an ounce of respect for is the female field Biologist (can't remember her name).  1. She vaguely reminds me of Rachel Maddow   1. She is there with the intent to be convinced, but after however many seasons, she remains firmly "the sceptic." 1. When ever I'm yelling something at the TV, about how those tree scratches are probably just a goddamned bear, she eventually tells them it was probably just a bear, even if they ignore her. 1. I'm sure it's likely most of what she says is semi-scripted to keep people like me from turing off the TV every 5 minutes, but dammit if she doesn't give me a scientific-method-chuby.  I usually tend to watch it when I'm drunk, if that makes anything make more sense.

c8cuq5d	4	0	I watch it too.  I keep hoping that when they do a "bigfoot call" that a bigfoot will come charging out of the woods, rip the arm off of one guy and beat another guy to death with the dismembered arm. The other two will have to make a run for it and the rest of the episode is a death race out of the woods.  The one episode the guy did a "bigfoot mating call". Episode after episode they tell us how strong and agile bigfoot is. Is sexually teasing a giant, angry beast a well thought out thing to do?  Ghost Adventures and Finding Bigfoot are both dirty little habits to me.

c8cw691	1	1	As someone who is into cryptozoology, this slightly irks me. 
c8cw6d6	1	0	I knew they were never gonna find anything on Bigfoot, but what made me permanently tune out was this episode where they used rotten meat piles and hunting trip-cams to lure bigfoot. The meat pile vanished cleanly, but they never mentioned the cameras.

I saw one about a year ago and it was something like there are no bigfoot bones because porcupines eat them. Seriously, I think there are no bigfoot bones because there are no bigfoots.

c8cryz3	3	9	Can we try, maybe for just a week, not adding "fucking" to everything like it automatically makes everything funnier?  This would have been funnier without the "fucking."

c8czr16	1	0	relevant: [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/language/stories/sirloin.asp) 
c8crt1g	6	2	Actually, I've heard that the reason they are called sirloin, is because a king enjoyed his steak so much that he stood up from the table and knighted the piece of meat with his sword and pronounced it "sir loin."    I don't know how true that is,  but I heard it. 
c8crwmb	6	0	The "sir" part is from the French "sur", meaning "above." 
c8cry2b	4	0	Well that actually makes logical sense, because the sirloin is *above* the loin, right?  The Knight thing is probably some bullshit people tell kids.

c8cqbw8	18	4	Butter doesn't make you diabetic .
c8csxhe	4	0	It was probably more like the jars of mayonnaise she added to stuff. And the pounds of sugar. The copious amounts of fried food probably didn't help either.  
c8cu85j	2	0	Mayo also won't make you diabetic. Ingredients: vegetable oil, egg, lemon juice. Maybe a few preservatives if store bought.  Sugar on the other hand, oh God.
c8cucxq	1	0	I can't say I know much about diabetes, but when my mother was diagnosed last year one of the things they emphasized was trying to get her cholesterol down to help with it. Eggs = cholesterol, which is where my line of thought on that came from. 
c8cunpt	2	0	It takes one egg to make a LOT of mayo (way more than a single jar). It's only added to emulsify the oil. A majority of mayo is vegetable oil, but people typically only use a little bit of it anyway.
c8creao	3	12	Still not good for you
c8crn3q	5	2	I eat real butter every day. I exercise and work hard daily. Cholesterol , weight and all other indicators are great. So don't blame butter Or sugar or meat or any 1 thing for people's lifestyle choices as a whole. People need to be personally responsible.

c8cswk9	5	2	NPH wouldn't be relevant whatsoever.  This is also not Julia Child.  This is Paula Dean, the reason why she is relevant is because she uses a ridiculous amount of butter in her cooking.  Just because NPH's character "Barney" uses "challenge accepted" a lot doesn't mean that he's the better choice.  I don't find this post to be particularly funny, and I love NPH, but it would have made *no* sense with NPH.

c8cu8ij	22	10	Yeah thats whats weird to me. Having a girlfriend is cheaper to me, not more expensive. When I'm without a girlfriend, I'm always out... bars, movies, clubs, concerts... but when I have a girlfriend, I do those things less because I am waiting on her to be free so we can go together. That and we spend time just at home together. I don't understand how having a girlfriend is more expensive than not...
c8cvv6u	5	0	I stop leaving the house entirely when I have a gf.  My only reason to strike out into the world and make an effort to be social and/or charming is so I can find sex.  Once I have sex at home I don't really give a shit about going out anymore.
c8cueyp	12	14	Because most guys have the "girly" type of girlfriends who love for their boyfriend to take them out to dinner and to shows and spend money on them. Strangely, i enjoy spending money on my dates 
c8cugil	5	2	well... I do enjoy taking my lady out, my argument is that when I actually have a girlfriend, I'm not going out as much because I'm wanting to spend time with her so we work around each others work schedules and such. Unless the guy does absolutely nothing with his time while single, it really should not be that much more expensive to have a girlfriend.
c8cvjc3	2	1	Or you simply have uncommonly expensive hobbies. I can buy a new video game every week, go climbing at the local rock gym 3/4 times a week, and go hiking every weekend and it will cost me about $150 a month. Going out to a non-shitty dinner once a week with a date costs $40-60/night (~$200/month) *without* any drinks.

c8ctjd1	8	3	The only interest he'd be earning on it is the interest of the guy behind him in line at the store.... Right guys!?!? 
c8ctnt1	9	16	Says the guy with no money. I always carry 300-400...
c8cuyqn	2	1	Same here.
c8cvrel	3	0	let me know next time you are out and about so I can rob you 
c8ctyng	10	3	you dont use a credit/debit card?
c8cx5kq	2	0	And I bet its the only 300-400 you have.
c8csker	15	4	I think OP is confused about a callgirl GFE and a real girlfriend. 
c8cs38h	49	31	If your relationship revolved around you spending money on her, then you must have been pretty boring to not come up with things to do.
c8cuf4n	27	29	You can come up with things to do until you are blue in the face. The trouble comes when you realize things to do cost money, and ~~girls~~ *people in relationships* like to do things that cost money *to prevent things from getting stale or boring*.  You are being pretty smug with your assumption, but what do you suggest a guy and a girl do that wouldn't bear an expense? Build sheet forts? Make snowmen? Walk the dog?   I can assure you that if everything you can think of to do with your girl is free, she will call you not only boring, but a cheap ass, as she leaves you for the guy willing to spend a dime or two on a good time that is worth it.  Edit: all of you who think you are the exception to this rule, realize you are not the majority. And those of you that think I am wrong are naive. If you are going to downvote me, at least make sure you aren't basing your opinions of the situation on highschool dating, where your parents provide all the logistics and "just hanging out" is an option and costs nothing.
c8cvvmi	5	1	This. Ex gf called me monotonous. She didn't have a car. I told her it costs money to drive places or do anything really. She disagreed.  She grew up having money in her bank account that was all given to her as Christmas presents and could travel 2-3x a year, every year.
c8cuzw0	12	4	It's a two way street.. Guys like do to things that cost money just as well as girls do. But, it's pretty simple to find things to do that don't cost money. Go for a walk, have a movie night at home, have a fire in your back yard, build a fort. Just because you can't think of anything... Not all girls need to be wined and dined every time you hang out with them.. Jus sayin
c8cxt9f	2	2	&gt;build a fort.  Are you in fucking middle school?
c8cy0i5	2	1	Nope.. Sure am not.
c8cz6yo	1	1	You must be in highschool and going through that "I'm too cool for cute things" stage. 
c8czs5w	1	0	I'm in college. I've never *ever* heard someone describe "building a fort" as "cute." I did that shit with boxes when I was a toddler. What else do you recommend, raking a pile of leaves and then jumping in it? Is that cute too?  Jesus Christ, be original. Just because you did that shit as a child doesn't mean "it's cute."
c8czwcq	1	0	Well, that's just like your opinion or something man.  Some people enjoy being silly even into adulthood. No one is trying to be "original" here, just throwing out some cheap date ideas. 
c8cwn4a	3	3	You need to pay for that movie, or, the service that lets you watch it. Firewood costs money unless you own land where you can chop it. Same goes for the rediculous fort idea.   Your list is short, and it excludes anyone who doesn't have access to a fireplace or wood. To be clear, every single person that responded to me missed the point of what I was saying. And the fact that the dude was trying to act like anyone who spends money is boring/ not creative.  Edit: I don't know where you were going with the "just because you can't think of anything" but that is not the case. And I never said girls want to be wined and dined **every** time. But realistically, if you actively avoid spending money, they **will** take notice, and probably want greener pastures. If you think you are different, or your SO is different, then you are the **exception**, not the rule. Deal with it.
c8cukfb	10	6	try talking.
c8cwrpc	1	0	People in relationships talk all day every chance they get. We were on the subject of activities, not simple acts of day to day relating.
c8cxi3q	1	2	Bitter much?
c8cxovw	1	0	Not at all. I'm in a loving relationship and we both make plenty of money. I just don't buy that people think doing nothing that costs money=better relationship, better creativity or whatever movie fantasy of love they have in their poor naive highschool hearts.
c8culzh	2	7	upvote for you sir.
c8cxtlz	1	1	*Implying relationships are cheap.*
c8ctmyp	3	0	The ol "show the hundred the rest dollars" trick. 
c8ctnqt	2	1	If you go out with a girl that does nothing but spend all your dough...   .... you're gonna have a bad time.
c8cumsp	1	0	I was expecting a pizza joke...
c8ctuke	3	0	Did you sell her stuff or something?
c8cwh8f	1	0	His earlier post was a picture of all his games and shit smashed with a hammer in a box. He broke up with his GF and she decided to smash his shit. I'm assuming he took her to small claims court, won and got compensation for her actions.
c8cx6vm	1	0	No, it wasn't.
c8ctvgn	4	0	How was your first day back as a gigolo?
c8cui7s	3	0	**[fixed]^[fixed]^[fixed]^[fixed]^[fixed]^[fixed]**
c8cvkia	2	1	this is becoming the new "gem"
c8cssv5	10	6	This is actually how I felt after a broke up with a girl who was convinced that a healthy relationship required me to show her how much I loved her every single second we were together.  When we first started dating, I spent about $1,300 in the course of one month when I was in my sophomore year of college and working a job that paid minimum wage + tips. Now that we're not together, it's incredibly easy to save for things because she isn't complaining that I never have food at my house that she prefers and... the list goes on.
c8cywk7	2	0	&gt;I spent about $1,300 in the course of one month  That's your fault dude. There will always be people - of any gender - looking to take advantage of somebody who is easy to take advantage of.
c8cz7ru	1	0	Sorry to hear that man, I hope you can stick up for yourself in the future. 
c8cux6w	9	12	She wanted to eat food that she likes? What a bitch.
c8cv0ra	8	1	No, she complained of me not having a bunch of food that she likes on a limited budget instead of purchasing her own/bringing her own food over. I do not like vegetarian food, so I have absolutely no motivation to buy it, and having someone complain that I didn't buy any vegetarian food last time I went to the store is just a little rude. Especially when they'd rather spend their money on going out to dinner with all their friends instead, or just never think to actually bring food over in case I may not have bought something they like, that I seriously dislike.
c8cw9cy	1	0	It sounds like she was a picky-ass bitch who should have spent her own money to buy the food she prefers. 
c8cwwbx	1	1	Gender roles are only fair when pointed towards men, guis! He should have bought her anything she wanted because she is a princess and deserves to be taken care of and not have to work/provide for herself, JEEZE! Misogynist, white/skinny-privilege loving bigots! Probably all just a bunch of basement dwelling neckbeards that don't get laid anyways!!!  What? No, I've never heard the term "Hypocrite" before, and frankly I think you are just making words up, now! 
c8crlbe	30	23	This post makes no sense.
c8crsm4	6	18	He's implying that she was sued and now he has all that money.
c8crxhv	21	11	Nope. Implying that he doesn't spend money on her stupid shit anymore.
c8crzq0	4	14	Either way, he still has more money. She can be sued for what she did, which is a criminal offence. So technically both ways can be true.
c8cs2aq	4	1	What thread do you think you're in?
c8cuxwo	3	0	He's referring to the original post in which the guy's ex-gf destroyed all of his games. People were telling him to sue her in small claims court.
c8csc7m	3	1	Yeah, but the "Last night, I broke up with my girlfriend" is suggestive of a short time period. Such as a day.
c8cuums	1	0	Check out the /r/gaming post, this guy's gf smashed his shit.
c8cvo9a	1	0	Yeah, different guy, but I know the origins of this fixed fixed post.
c8crwyp	6	2	I don't think he's implying that she was sued, just that he now as all this money because he doesn't have to spend it on her.
c8cubhx	1	0	I think he's actually just implying that girlfriends are expensive.    I doubt his post has anything in common with the smashed up games other than the title. 
c8ctgls	18	12	Felt the same when I broke up with my boyfriend.
c8cuvio	6	2	My ex and I broke up about 2.5 months ago and ever since then life has been amazing! It was a four year relationship and I was going to extend my education to a Masters at my school (even though I don't really like being here) so that I was around her for her extra schooling years (undergrad then nursing school). But then she broke up with me, and seeing as how I already pretty much have a job at one of the big 5 tech companies, I don't even feel bad. I'm still getting my Masters, but now at a better school, while I'm working.  TL;DR: she saved me roughly $200K by leaving
c8cveb6	2	0	fucking awesome
c8cvyuu	2	0	Wooooooh!!! I went to grad school a little early because my ex gf's mother called me unambitious. I was waiting to go, but she pissed me off.  Needless to say, it wasn't enough because her mother hated me for being American. Now I'm gf-less and at the gym 4x a week.
c8cw57t	1	0	Nice, man... I have to say, I wasn't ready to be in mine, so I'm a lot better off now. I work out a lot, am learning to sing and play the piano... I'm just healthier, wealthier, and happier!
c8cw7t6	2	0	I'm finishing up grad school (last semester), so I won't learn to play anything until I find a new job :). I do have this geeky 12-hole ocarina that I bought!  
c8cw8v8	1	0	Hahaha... get ALL the women!
c8cwbqu	2	0	Psh. Whatever. I'll sing Sinatra at a Karaoke. That's all I need.
c8cutir	4	1	She watermarked your money? shit's rough bro.
c8cvfma	5	1	Man, she pixelated the shit out of your money. That's fucked up. 
c8csli4	5	2	You got some pixellated money? Sweet!!
c8cu195	2	0	One dollar bills is a bit more realistic for me.
c8cub0i	1	0	You make that much money in 1 night?  Must be 1 hell of a job
c8cultz	1	0	Plot twist: The rest of the bills are ones.
c8cupka	2	0	Pay at the hole!
c8cvk4a	1	1	This is interesting because as a guy I immediately think this, but does the girl ever freak out because now she has to pay for everything?
c8cvskg	1	0	~$137?  Sweet!
c8cwjry	1	0	Prostitution is profitable. Yay to the single life.
c8cx4u4	2	0	SRS up in this hoe! Watch them downvote, watch them troll!   I wish I could be a self-righteous hypocrite, that would be bad-ass. I would be able to turn any situation into making my sex the victim in any circumstance, and totally fuck over any chance of convincing any one other then people like me that I have a valid point!

c8cujyg	4	10	I'll never understand how they go through so much so fast.  I'm half expecting to find some elaborate art project under my sink one day.
c8cvd24	8	0	If you really want to know, we have to wipe EVERY TIME we pee.  We can't shake it out or whatever guys do.  It gets all up in our labia.    Reason 2:  we tend to wrap used tampons in tp so you don't have to see the red clotted mess in the trash.  If you'd rather deal with that imagery, go ahead and let your lady know your preference.
c8cvwcz	1	1	A roll lasts me at least a month, not unusual for two months.  When my GF stays over, they last maybe a week.  That's not explained away by pee and tampons.
c8cvz2b	1	0	They pad their vagina after they piss.
c8crz4u	6	4	Yeah, did you *really* have all that money. Come on now
c8cv3l1	4	3	1. Break up with girlfriend 2. ... 3. Profit!
c8cv0a1	3	1	So they amputated one of your hands huh
c8cv3tl	4	3	Ugh, prostitutes don't count as girlfriends.
c8cu2py	3	5	Nothing is more expensive then servicing one's own Cock. Try to keep that in mind as you bumble your way through life.
c8cureg	5	6	I broke up with Ms. Crazy this morning after a torrid, 3 month relationship.  I sat down, did an accounting and realized that I have spent like 40% of my take home income on her during that time.  All on bullshit.  I just booked a trip to Vegas for me, myself and I for the end of the month in her honor!  
c8cuw36	8	1	You need financial help.
c8cwr5t	1	0	Not really.  I live very modestly and I have a well paying job.

c8cwewr	1	4	If women made the same amount of money as men this wouldn't be a problem
c8czklz	1	0	They do.
c8cvvdk	2	10	Mommy and daddy's monthly spending money? Aww how cute.  So you left your wallet at home and came home and found the wallet full of cash? This is a fucking stupid way to brag about having cash that you didn't earn. Grow the fuck up junior.
c8cwz0x	5	0	Are you being serious?  First off, he didn't take a picture of his wallet, as is evident by the watermark.  Second, he was just making a joke, saying that now they are broken up he has plenty of extra  cash because he doesn't have to spend it on her.  I looked through your comments and you seem very troubled.  Maybe you're just a troll, but I feel that there's still some kind of feeling behind what you're saying.  And then, of course, the one random comment to r/cooking.  So...what's up?

c8cr9d2	4	1	Please educate me what "motorboating" means when used in reference to breasts? I've heard/seen the combination a few times, but have no clue what exactly it is supposed to mean.
c8creaa	9	0	&gt;The act of pushing one's face in between two ample breasts, and rocking one's head side to side very rapidly while making a vigorous, lip-vibrating "brrr" sound. *from Urban Dicitionary*
c8crlgj	5	1	Thanks. I generally don't trust Urban Dictionary, because a lot of the stuff sounds just too damn weird, like Encyclopaedia Dramatica style weird.  But I suppose that works :)

c8d0v2g	1	0	Wait, you're telling me climate doesn't correlate to political borders? I call bullshit.
c8cs9jj	12	3	You realize Canada goes pretty far north as well, right?  They're making a big deal about -51C in Siberia, the most desolate and far-flung part of Russia. For comparison, it was -45C in our capitol city, Ottawa, last week. And we're only an hour away from NY.
c8ctaa3	3	0	and that was one of the coldest parts of the country on that day. I don't remember why, but the whole country dropped below -20 for a couple days. Edmonton, Alberta was at -50 at some point there. But the weather has been ridiculous for the last month. -25 one day and +3 the next week.
c8csi1d	5	3	The thing about that city is that it's consistently extremely cold there. Ottawa can get pretty cold but it's not ~~consistently~~ constantly in the extremes.   Also, latitude does play a large roll in temperature however the surrounding geography is also pretty important. There are plenty of places fairly far north that have rather mild winters due to the surrounding geography, proximity to oceans (and resulting ocean currents), altitude etc. 
c8csu2q	5	4	&gt; constantly in the extremes  Have you been to Ottawa? It's -40 in the winters and 45 in the summers. It's the worst parts of Siberia and Arizona combined. Perhaps not constantly, but as you said, consistently, yes.  We basically get a good week in October and a good week in March.
c8ct8t4	7	4	So, a little research, the lowest temp on record for Ottawa is -38.9 on Dec 29, 1933. It has NEVER reached -45C.  I've been to Ottawa many times in the dead of winter for X-country ski races. At night it's not uncommon for it to drop below -20 in Jan and Feb however it can not compare to the town mentioned in Siberia.   Also, the record high is 38.7C. You may wish to check your numbers.   EDIT: Also, summers in Ottawa are quite pleasant. Yes, there are heat waves but they move on through and it is by no means consistently oppressive. 
c8ctq1u	5	3	I live here and have lived here for 20 years. I'm familiar with what the weather here is like.  Yes, my numbers were including humidity/windchill. Care to include those? Because I know for a fact that my estimates were under-reporting the data for 'feels like X temp.'  Edit to address passive aggressive edit: Summer in Ottawa is actually a lot like living in a steam-bath. It is oppressively humid and swamp-like.  Edit to preemptively address pending passive-aggressive edit: Yes, I have actually been in a swamp.
c8cpud9	2	16	Afghanistan has the coldest winters. Russia is Hawaii compared to theirs.
c8cq2gp	16	0	False.   Sources: Climates information for [Russia](http://www.russia.climatemps.com/) and [Afghanistan](http://www.afghanistan.climatemps.com/)  Russia has a lower average temperature by 8 degrees Celsius, almost double the amount of precipitation, more than double the amount of days with snow fall, and half the amount of sunshine hours.
c8cqv49	10	4	Meteorology'd, biatch!
c8cs3ur	5	0	No, Climatology'd biotch! 
c8cqlq2	2	0	It probably sucks even more because without a shit ton of snow(sure a little, but not like here) it looks so inviting and then suddenly BAM! It's freezing. 
c8cpczq	3	1	Exactly. It is funny here. Coldest mornings are maybe -2 Celsius, so I, being from new Jersey and having some limited understanding for how to dress for the cold would go to work at 7 am with long johns and a heavy wool "lumberjack" jacket on. Invariably at about nine when it would start to warm up someone wearing only a tee shirt would see me and laugh and ask " what are you cold?" To which I would reply, "No, are you ?"    
c8cprtz	4	0	-2C? If you're driving to work you should be wearing nothing more than a light sweatshirt. 
c8cqc0x	3	3	I don't know where you live but -2 is t-shirt weather where I live.
c8crec6	7	1	Saskatchewanian here. -2 is when I'd be outside in my underwear grilling some steak.
c8csliu	5	1	Normal Canadian here, I wear more clothes when i'm cold and less when it's warm to the tune of being comfortable without regard to what the number on the thermometer is. 
c8cwsjy	1	0	-2 isn't cold
c8d0vud	1	0	TIL bellow freezing isn't cold.
c8ctx4o	2	0	&gt;I'd be outside in my underwear grilling some steak.  Last week I woke up, started my laundry, and realized that I needed to put the trash out in a hurry before the garbage truck went by. It was about -15.  So I threw on some flannel pants and a t-shirt on and slipped into rubber boots, cause I didn't have to lace them. They are not insulated, but it was only going to be a brief trip outside.   I got the garbage out and while walking back, I thought, "I should shovel a path for the postal workers while I am out here". So I grabbed a shovel and did just that.   I wasn't quite uncomfortably chilly yet, so I did a bit more. Forty-five minutes later I had shovelled the whole driveway. Well, the only thing left to do was the deck, and I am a terrible procrastinator, so I figured, "Whats a few minutes more?" It wasn't going to kill me.  But I didn't want to traipse through the house, since I'd probably just sit down and forget about it. So that meant I had to shovel a path from the front yard around back, through deep snow, but a path might be handy anyway. I don't go back there much, but the cats make use of both doors.  So I shovelled my way around back, got up on the deck and cleared that off too. Then finally I went back inside and sat down.   Not long after the washing machine dinged, and I realized I had done all that with no underwear or socks on. They were all in the wash.   So my fellow Canadian, I guess what I am saying is that I know what you are talkin' about.
c8cuwdz	1	0	Floridian here, what are negative temperatures.
c8cv09m	1	0	What?   -15 Celsius is about 5 Fahrenheit. 
c8cs91e	1	0	I live in Chicago so our weather is somewhere down the middle of warm and cold. -2C on its own? Easy.  However once it gets windy fuck that entirely. Lightest of winds turns -2C to like -20C to me.
c8cwthw	1	0	I know that feel, it was -20C and the wind chill made it around -40C
c8cs4zz	1	0	Lived in the UK for 4 months. British people tend to shit their pants if it gets to -2. I would be wearing a light sweater and they'd all be wearing gloves n knitted hats haha. -2 is basically beach weather to me.  My train was delayed on the way to the airport my last day because of "severe weather conditions" which included very minor flurries that lasted half an hour AT MOST. 
c8cx7go	1	0	I lived in new York city before I moved to Australia and If a snow flake fell the entire city shut down and went into a flat panic. Up in the Adirondack mountains where we used to vacation, a foot of snow could drop in the night and by dawn the town would be plowing the back, back roads. Funny.

c8cqnnb	2	0	What Frosty Nuts?
c8cs0i8	1	0	And when it's warm in Canada
c8cr3js	1	3	"How aboot this weather, eh?"
c8cres0	4	1	Pfft.  Canadians don't say "aboot." That's silly, it's just an American stereotype of Canadians.  We really say "aboat."
c8crh6q	2	1	There's one specific type of Ontarian accent that says "aboot". I've heard it once in my life.
c8crkxy	2	1	I've been all across the land, never heard a single one.  Irish or Scottish immigrants used to have a thick accent.. probably started because of that.
c8crtqa	1	0	Maybe, but far more Canadians say "aboat."
c8cpf4w	50	5	This happens at near melting temperatures. When its really cold here, there isn't enough moisture to do that.  
c8css86	6	0	Yep... that is caused by freezing precipitation of some kind (drizzle, rain, or fog).  just a few degrees below freezing is the worst range for this.   Source:  Pilot and flying in this shit is deadly, so we know about it..
c8ctcvb	3	0	Yup, plus slushy road will do this every time. Wait until it builds up around the wheel wells and you can't turn the wheels. It happens on extended freeway trips with little steering  input.
c8cpq1u	9	5	I'll second this.

c8cpvyh	6	0	You know its cold in canada if you live in fucking canada
c8cr6z2	3	0	to be fair, at least in central Ontario, it's been a pretty mild winter.
c8crgrr	4	0	Just like the last 15-20 consecutive winters.  Seriously what happened to a heavy, winter-long snow cover? Best we get here (Niagara) is a foot and a half, which melts after a week or two. Been that way at least the last 5 years, anyhow.
c8crkvi	1	0	I have terrible memory, but I'm pretty sure last winter was pretty cold in Barrie (hour north of Toronto). But I'm sure by this time next year I'll be saying the same about this winter. But really, I'm not complaining. Fuck the cold.
c8crt6s	1	0	Yeah, Barrie is a little less shielded from the harsh weather than Niagara is; the Great Lakes tend to act as a buffer, for Niagara.
c8cs68h	2	0	last year in Alberta is only got to -30 once.. it was an eerily baumy winter..
c8cpkyg	5	0	You know it's cold in Canada. The end.
c8crgfn	1	0	Reddit, once again, proves that I have no original thoughts. 
c8cn0mv	5	2	That looks pretty awesome!
c8co3cj	3	0	You experience icing on your lug nuts
c8coqr2	10	3	nutcicles
c8co41r	4	0	Is that the slush from the road freezing onto the lugs while you are driving?  Naa I will stick with my 42 c here in Perth. 
c8cpt9a	1	1	Probably not. Guessing it is the same thing as when fog freezes to trees and fences. Just this time it was on a car.   Basically, the small water drops in the fog hit the cold metal and and instantly freeze, and it builds up. 
c8crfnf	3	0	If that were the case, it would be building up on the leading edges, not the trailing edges. It's just water/slop from the road.
c8cs0u1	1	1	Not nessisarly. All the ice is pointing in mostly the same direction. Nothing in that picture says that the car was moving. 
c8cs33i	4	0	Uh, look again. The ice, on every bolt, stretches away from the center of the wheel. The leading edge is where it connects to the bolt, and it stretches away radially.
c8cn14c	8	4	Eh, not really "funny," but cool nonetheless.
c8cp832	1	0	Cold enough to freeze the nuts off a steel bridge.

c8cq4s2	1	0	This happened on my dad's truck one time, driving across TN and AR.  but the icicles were pointing directly out to the tire (radius) on all six lugs and it was magical.
c8cq7zg	1	0	Is it because the turning wheel almost simulates an outward gravity and makes icicles?

c8cru5c	2	0	You're telling me you saw this and went HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA?
c8crv07	2	0	It's also cold anywhere else when that happens.  I used to have radial icicles from the centers of my hubcaps all the time.    You actually ONLY get them when it's not too cold.  If it's REALLY cold, there's no melted water to get on the caps and form these things in the first place.

c8cujsl	1	0	That's what we call humid... if it was that cold, that ice would have never been in that state, it would have been frozen on the ground.  This seems to me like the wheel rode onto the water, that wasn't frozen, and the wind made it go icy.   Opinions?

c8cuj09	22	9	Ugh. It's "didn't go with," isn't it? Sorry, my education was poor and in Dutch.
c8cyr6j	3	0	I feel so bad for you, English is a terrible language and everyone on the Internet is ruthless about stuff like this. 
c8cxdv2	1	5	A more accurate way to say that phrase would probably be "At least I didn't go with that level of shit." Still doesn't make much sense, but most English doesn't, if you sit down and think about it. Try not to. It'll make your head hurt.
c8cyqc5	3	0	Nah he meant "level" shit referencing the awful titles 'undressing level:asian'

c8cyvoz	3	2	A guy...  You mean an ex-cop fired for reporting abuse.  Important details.  
c8d0miz	1	0	They did an inquiry and found out it was a false report and an attempt to get back at his training officer for giving him poor marks. Read some un-biased shit once awhile. 
c8cw5dg	1	2	The same thing is going on in AZ except the guy who is killing everyone is a cop.... The world sucks sometimes. 
c8cxi15	1	0	The guy in Cali was a cop I guess.
c8cymi5	2	2	The killer was driving a Nissan Titan which was eventually found at the bottom of a lake. So now they have no idea what he's driving and they are practically opening fire on anyone who doesn't pull over right away.
c8cyw2s	3	3	The killer?  You mean ex-cop fired for reporting police abuse and brutality?
c8cyzqz	3	0	Yes. He was fired and now is believed to have killed 3 people as a "revenge" attack.
c8cz17p	2	5	Fired for?  Come on.  Testifying against another officer in court regarding police brutality  Come on.
c8cz3gn	2	0	I'm not sure what you're getting at... All I'm saying is what was reported. I'm not agreeing with anything that's going on. I'm only saying there is a guy who is an ex cop who has allegedly killed 3 people, and now LAPD is shooting up vehicles.
c8cz9qu	1	5	I have issue with people saying "some guy is killing LAPD cops"  It leaves out the fact that the LAPD fucking deserve it,  and had it coming.
c8czar9	5	1	They deserve to die because of an idiotic decision? Yea, bit much. But I don't argue with people on the Internet. So I will bid you good day.

In fact, I don't really know of any that werent, and as a football player in high school, you saw a lot of them in the locker rooms and whatnot. (Not a big deal.)
c8cs90r	27	4	Yeah, but you are us-american. It's usual for us-american men to be circumcised.

c8cos67	36	7	The last name is French. Thus it is pronounced as /gye/
c8cpvkl	22	6	French guy here. Can confirm, this is a French name. There was actually a guy in my highschool with this name as well. Guy is actually a quite popular last name, pronounce 'guh-ee' in 1 syllable. Christian is also a popular in French, but it's also decently popular in English as well.   EDIT: side note, the guy from highschool. We definitely called him "christian guy" with English pronunciation.

c8cp35s	62	22	Why is it unfortunate?
c8cq37d	31	6	Because it's confusing. In the picture, it looks like it's just a label describing him as some "Christian Guy." His name generally might prevent him from being taken seriously. I imagine that happens for a lot of people with "Guy" in their names, though.

c8cqcyr	26	6	No. It's a bad name because it's confusing. Looks like a label, and not a name. Even if he is Christian, it's wierd.
c8cqjzb	16	1	In fact, if he *is* a Christian, it's weird, and probably annoying for him at parties.  "So your name is Christian Guy?"  "...yes..."  "Are you a CHRISTIAN GUY? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA."  "...yes..."

c8ct8ln	2	2	this doesn't seem realistic. i mean, do you introduce yourself to strangers with your first and last name? i sure as hell don't. i've known people for 8 years without them learning what my last name is. the only place it seems like people introduce themselves with their last name is a professional environment, where others are probably going to have more tact than to make dumb comments about a name.

c8cqjd5	8	2	What?  It's unfortunate because some people might not take him seriously, since it looks like a generic label instead of a name.  Imagine if you were were watching the news and a scientist came on to talk about his expert opinion, and his name was "Random Person".  Unless you knew that "Random Person" was his name, you would think it was literally just a random person talking about whatever.

c8cu32e	2	2	It's not unfortunate I'm with you.
c8cpy2t	7	13	Because Reddit is an athiest circlejerk for 14 year olds.
c8cqp0j	8	2	It's nothing to do with that at all. Having a name like Christian Guy makes it seem as if the reporter is just some Christian guy they pulled off of the street. Similar to how they label people as 'Shop worker' or 'Concerned parent' that kind of thing.

c8cqrbh	1	3	Also has "christian" and "justice" in the same caption.
c8cqir6	2	3	Two first names, can't trust him. That is unfortunate.
c8crcsd	2	3	I don't get it, do parents simply not perceive what will happen? I guess it could be argued that with the last name Guy you're probably used to the word "Guy" being related to your last name, not its normal use. Thus, the connection never hits you when thinking of a name...but still, how does this fly over their heads?

c8cnskt	162	27	The dough was too warm - that's what causes the dough to melt like that.  (Serious answer in case she wants to try hearts again. But if she prefers dick cookies keep that dough warm!)
c8cpca1	111	17	I don't think that this was caused by dough temperature, see if your dough is too warm your hearts will just look like a formless blobs, but on these cookies you can clearly see "shaft", which means that they were intentionally assembled that way.
c8cqgx7	40	8	Came here to say the same thing but you beat me to it.  You can see where they've been pinched to intentionally form the shaft.  OP, if you wanted to make dick cookies, that's cool.  Just say you made dick cookies and take pride in your lust for dickerdoodles.      
c8cqnzg	63	3	[It came out of a press, note the heart shape one](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fFOC1jPFZrs/TN9r7-P1DcI/AAAAAAAADwA/nRPbBxYJJiE/s1600/cookie_pro_ultra_II_shapes_large.jpg)
c8cqx6b	25	3	I agree that it came out of a press and that's actually really good work finding the molds. If you look at the shape that press made though, it's highly unlikely that the shape would have changed the way OP said it did without pinching.  Also, if you look at one in the front right you can fairly clearly tell where the fingers were pinching the cookie from the way it is shaped.    Misshapen cookies from dough being pressed incorrectly or cookies having too little flour/baked at the wrong temp/etc. is fairly common.  However, they would not come out as uniform as this. If the dough was pressing wrong there would have been a couple of misshapen cookies and gradually the form would have corrected.  If the temperature was wrong there'd be less uniformity in the shape of the cookies so you'd only see 1 or 2 dick cookies.  It also would cause the shape to expand out, not in.  This seems pretty intentionally done.  Just my 2 cents. 
c8csf08	5	1	I can assure you it wasn't intentional. The forms above are the press she used. She didn't even notice it really, about half of them came out that way. I had to point them out because I'm clearly immature.   She was embarrassed actually, she takes her baking seriously and doesn't like when things don't turn out right.

c8ctc4g	3	0	I'm a preschool teacher. When it's time to help the kids get ready to play outside, I can only help 1 or 2 out of the 20 kids at a time...so while I'm zipping someone's coat and helping someone balance while they step into boots, there are at least 6 kids figuring out how to do this in different parts of the room.

c8cpmtm	4	1	I see two big balls with tiny penis
c8cq048	10	0	I see a chicken foot squashing balls and a tiny penis. 
c8cp9jq	32	2	She wants the Y
c8cnskt	162	27	The dough was too warm - that's what causes the dough to melt like that.  (Serious answer in case she wants to try hearts again. But if she prefers dick cookies keep that dough warm!)
c8cpca1	111	17	I don't think that this was caused by dough temperature, see if your dough is too warm your hearts will just look like a formless blobs, but on these cookies you can clearly see "shaft", which means that they were intentionally assembled that way.
c8cqgx7	40	8	Came here to say the same thing but you beat me to it.  You can see where they've been pinched to intentionally form the shaft.  OP, if you wanted to make dick cookies, that's cool.  Just say you made dick cookies and take pride in your lust for dickerdoodles.      
c8cqnzg	63	3	[It came out of a press, note the heart shape one](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fFOC1jPFZrs/TN9r7-P1DcI/AAAAAAAADwA/nRPbBxYJJiE/s1600/cookie_pro_ultra_II_shapes_large.jpg)
c8cqx6b	25	3	I agree that it came out of a press and that's actually really good work finding the molds. If you look at the shape that press made though, it's highly unlikely that the shape would have changed the way OP said it did without pinching.  Also, if you look at one in the front right you can fairly clearly tell where the fingers were pinching the cookie from the way it is shaped.    Misshapen cookies from dough being pressed incorrectly or cookies having too little flour/baked at the wrong temp/etc. is fairly common.  However, they would not come out as uniform as this. If the dough was pressing wrong there would have been a couple of misshapen cookies and gradually the form would have corrected.  If the temperature was wrong there'd be less uniformity in the shape of the cookies so you'd only see 1 or 2 dick cookies.  It also would cause the shape to expand out, not in.  This seems pretty intentionally done.  Just my 2 cents. 
c8csf08	5	1	I can assure you it wasn't intentional. The forms above are the press she used. She didn't even notice it really, about half of them came out that way. I had to point them out because I'm clearly immature.   She was embarrassed actually, she takes her baking seriously and doesn't like when things don't turn out right.

c8cpgi6	25	9	I love cookies and I [bake](/r/trees) a lot.
c8cpfus	6	0	Your heart is a formless blob.
c8cpefc	12	2	That was my thought. I get blobs, but the rounding on the balls is too intentional
c8cpehm	25	6	They're Spritz cookies made using a cookie press. Some times the press shapes don't always turn out so well...
c8cq1aj	13	5	Yes, exactly - but you still need a decently chilled dough to avoid dong cookies.
c8coenq	72	12	Maybe she's making cookies shaped like small penises to tell you something, OP.
c8coxu2	38	6	Are you sure she's not saying his balls are proportionally huge?
c8code7	77	17	I guess theoretically, they still remain in the correct spirit of the holiday.

c8crayp	1	0	Your GF's accurate representation of the size of your genitals is pretty cool, but the fact that you posted it on the internet shows a slight lack of judgement.  You must be really proud of her work.

c8cxule	9	2	Can you con the referee in ice hockey to get an opponent sent off though ? it's one of those things that's good and bad about Football the yellow and red card rule are there to protect players and the same players it protects can bring the game into disrepute.   All I can say is you see the same ''bleeding heads and carrying on attitude'' from many players in professional football/soccer as well, no doubt outnumbered 100/1 with the divers but still Terry Butcher from way back enjoy http://cdn.worldcupblog.org/england.worldcupblog.org/files/2009/02/butcher.jpg http://u.goal.com/2800/2896.jpg

c8d0643	2	1	Ronaldo on man u? Didn't want a recent picture? 
c8cyhzj	4	2	While this can be true for some players, there are some pretty horrific soccer injuries. Just last week Demba Ba from Chelsea Fc got kicked in the face and broke his nose.   If I weren't on my phone, oh the clips I would link.  In EPL players that dive get carded all the time.
c8cyx6a	14	1	A broken nose happens like every week in the NHL, thats also a pretty minor injury. 
c8d0k2q	2	0	If you're in the NHL an you don't break your nose every so often something's wrong. 
c8d0oqh	2	2	Today Nathan Baker was forced off because he had an exactly similar head injury and was dripping from the face.  Would have kept playing but you aren't allowed to with open wounds like that until they're treated.  I don't understand why people feel the need to bash other sports.  Hockey is more violent, okay cool, if that's your thing go for it.  Might as well waste your time yelling about tennis being less manly because there aren't bloody injuries.
c8d0se7	1	0	Did he keep playing?
c8cwfhq	6	2	I love soccer. Too bad this is as true as it is.
c8d0w9r	1	0	Still I'd play soccer to get payed a shit load of money
c8d0xjs	1	0	I understand soccer is challenging, but dude, in hockey; you run on KNIFES. Can you not understand the badasatry of that, your on your foot?Well I'm on a bloody foot long saber attached to my feet as a slide across a surface at high speeds with people beating the shit out of me. (hockey-1, soccer-0) 
c8cwg2p	8	7	And here I thought it was soccer players play on grass, with their feet, etc., while hockey players play on ice with sticks.If you're still not sure  [Soccer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football)  [Hockey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey)

c8d0s53	1	1	sounds like a messi fag
c8cye7s	3	8	The thing people don't see is that soccer has no protective gear. Why don't you try getting a hard kick in the balls without a cup?
c8cykq1	10	0	Soccer has no protective gear? Man that sure makes them tough. [Oh wait.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xk_yEMmn3Vw/TnKhtDuX2-I/AAAAAAAAAuo/dN5Ae0ueJbk/s1600/Rugby_Player.jpg)

c8coe1u	12	0	Yay! Ben and Jerry's has been selling stamps to stamp all your money to get money out of politics.  http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/09/25/ben-cohen--citizens-united-stamping-money/70001108/1#.URfELh37JrU  Looks like some of it is starting to get around!

c8coddj	11	5	One dollar isn't enough. You need a corporate budget to pull it off.
c8coi2o	13	4	Yeah. I concur. If your bribing a politician with  a $1 bill, your doing it wrong.   It would take at least  tree fiddy

c8crqw5	3	0	Nah. Wire transfers and pennies.

c8cvfo4	2	0	"Listen, I don't have the money with me, but I'm going to write some stuff down on this piece of paper.  Just take it to these people, they'll totally take care of it."
c8ct83s	5	1	It's part of a campaign called [Stamp Stampede](http://stampstampede.org/), started by the [Movement Resource Group](http://movementresourcegroup.org/).   The idea is that money circulates a lot, all around the country, and if enough people start putting stamps like this on their bills it'll become a movement, basically forcing more attention to the issue. It doesn't inherently *change* anything, and the money is still useable. It's a publicity thing. Not a bad idea in my opinion.  *And yes, Ben Cohen of Ben&amp;Jerry's is taking a big part in the Stamp Stampede.
c8crb71	1	0	Nah they use bank transfers and similar.  I doubt any of them even know what a dollar is.  They probably see a twenty as "pocket change" anyway.
c8czl7b	1	0	"Money comes in fractions of a twenty now?"
c8cs7rh	2	0	Who bribes with a dollar?
c8cthn0	2	0	I was working as a cashier a couple weeks ago, and when I was cashing out at the end of the night, about 75% of my $1 bills were stamped with this.
c8cuf1k	1	0	I had one of these the other day. I thought it was hilarious.  All that I could picture was some angry, bitter guy pounding the stamp onto hundreds of dollar bills. "I'll show those bastards," he says to no one.

c8cwmg5	1	0	You could bribe Obama by just saying "I also hate the constitution" 
c8cwyq1	1	0	This is lifted from a grass-roots "zero rupee bill" campaign in India, intended to highlight and try to get rid of the petty bribery that is part of everything that goes on.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7137567/India-issues-zero-rupee-banknotes.html  Unfortunately the real problem there, as here, is with large, systemic corruption which makes an inked-up dollar banknote even less useful than a fart in a hurricane, since money is handled by laundering 501c4 corporations, PACs and the like.  This is instructive:   http://www.rawstory.com/rawreplay/2011/09/colbert-explains-roves-money-laundering-scheme/  
c8cx07q	1	0	I think they would get non circulated bills of much larger amounts.
c8czp8e	1	0	I actually talked to Ben about this (he's a family friend) The goal of stamping money is to get the issue out there and to get people talking. You can find out more (and buy stamps) here: https://movetoamend.org/

c8cq2fe	53	5	Yeah my Dunkin requires us to give free coffee/donuts to any officers in uniform. They give awesome tips, so I'm not complaining!
c8cr1yk	16	6	wouldn't you if your shit was free? haha
c8crf2b	27	7	Many police departments require that officers give tips that are  at least equal to the price of anything they are given for free.
c8ctmbg	8	1	In my city police officers aren't allowed to take anything for free because they consider it "bribes" and don't want preferential treatment.
c8cwsgt	1	0	Yeah, it's so hard to turn down free chipotle....
c8crgko	13	7	ah I like that policy, and it makes a good way of not getting any antitrust issues

c8cqbwx	40	2	Wow, that's actually really smart when you put it that way, and her* employees probably don't come in high.  EDIT: sorry!
c8cqd51	49	8	Think about it.  Donut places are usually open all night or open really late and really early.  The cops provide free protection at bad hours of the day, and in return the receive free or discounted stuff.  It is a symbiotic relationship.
c8crh5d	13	1	Sounds like racket doughnuting.

c8cu1mj	2	0	A lot of big cities make it all over reddit. New York, LA, Mumbai, Hong Kong. Interesting shit goes on in all of them and there are so many people ready to snap a picture. However, I have never seen a bigger state with a dedicated Reddit following than GA. Every day there's some weird picture taken in GA. Not just ATL, but all over GA. This county, or than county. "I know exactly where that is, because I live right there." "Yeah, me too!"  There's nothing really special about GA other than Atlanta, but there seem to be so many post about it! I do live in GA, so I never mind it, but it makes me wonder, why?   Is there just nothing to do here, so we all go on Reddit? Is GA a hell of a lot more interesting than other states? Do I just notice it more because I live here? Or is Reddit tracking my IP and just showing me all the GA post?  Besides the "Minnesota Karma Train" that comes along occasionally, I never hear from other random states. What's going on in Idaho? Are there Redditors in Vermont?
c8cs6jt	7	0	This looks like the Dunkin Donuts in my hometown (Douglasville, GA).  Really great service/food there.
c8csclg	4	0	Just because I saw this on reddit I'll be stopping at that store today.

c8cyy3a	1	0	I have a lot of good memories because of that DD.  All the way back from when I was pretty young (maybe 10 or 11 - I'm 27 now) of my dad picking up doughnuts from there on Sunday mornings.  Double chocolate for me and maple for my brother.  Good times.
c8cq49s	19	5	I was going to ask if people thought this was bad for business, but I guess not. It doesn't scare away the stoners looking for a sugar fix? There are more of them than cops.  However I do notice the conspicuous lack of blue pickup trucks in the parking lot.
c8cqf3t	6	0	Probably scares away tweakers looking for a fix too.  Pluses and minuses.
c8crdd5	3	0	&gt;It doesn't scare away the stoners looking for a sugar fix? There are more of them than cops.  i used to work for dunkin donuts, definitely more cops than stoners.  dunkin d's not really the go-to place for stoners, anyway, hell it's not even much of a place for people under 25.
c8crvac	1	0	but is that BECAUSE it's so popular for police that the stoners are all scared away?
c8cq44s	4	0	I too live in that town...did a double take when I saw the cop cars!

c8d0rg0	1	0	I knew I recognized that dunkin donuts, I go there all the time 
c8cpnnz	22	4	I worked at Dunkin' for a year in college.  Two cops came in one night and it went something like this:   **Cop 1:** "Hey there, two jelly donuts please"  **Me:** (don't laugh, it's a totally normal order, he just happens to be a cop)  "Alright"  **Cop 2:** "I'd like a bacon egg and cheese on an english muffin, with extra bacon"  **Me:** (can't help but smile now, punching in their order) "Okay"  **Cop 2**: "And I'll take a jelly donut as well"  **Me:** (dear god, keep it together)  **Cop 2:** "I know...bacon and jelly donuts.  The stereotype is true"  **Me:** (nervous laugh) "I wasn't going to say anything..."  Then everyone was smiling and laughing - one of my more fond interactions with customer(s).    Good guys.
c8cy2ik	1	0	I liked the part of this story where they didn't beat the fuck out of you.  A lot of cops are good guys.
c8cplo9	17	1	Fun fact: this whole stereotype started (according to my father who started work as a police officer back in the 70's) because back then one of the few types of stores that tended to be open all night were donut shops. They were frequented by cops working the night shift because that was the only place they could get coffee
c8cqgq0	8	1	If shawarma places were open super late, I'd go there instead.
c8ctc0p	3	0	And then there would be a stereotype about misadventurists always eating shawarma.
c8ct1aj	1	0	Was about to say this.  Dunkin' Donuts is open super early, have good coffee, and of course good breakfast grub.  Also, if you're in the Northeast, Dunkin' Donuts is the place to be in the morning no matter who you are. 
c8co74m	36	9	Sigh.
c8cpfum	12	1	There, there. It's alright.
c8cpl6e	6	1	Drink a warm beverage.
c8cp6q1	14	2	If you work in an office you probably have a coffee machine. These fine gentleman work in their cars and have to purchase their coffee.   Full disclosure: I'm not a police officer.
c8cov7g	8	0	To be fair, that's a busy intersection and there's a sketchy ass liquor store right next to it.
c8cq2go	5	0	Awesome ass liquor store you mean
c8cvv2v	1	0	One of those corners where they sell crack and heroin but you can also go inside for booze if you want? 
c8coxzq	17	2	Building wall behind the cars is a Long John Silver's. Crazy I know but cops probably like to eat during their shift. 
c8cngv5	13	6	Their cars are backed in. You know, so they can get out in a hurry if they have to.
c8cnkws	7	5	CAR NUMBER 20 WHATS YOUR STATUS??? Doughnuts are secured.
c8cpisd	7	1	Who knew there were so many Redditors that would recognise the hwy five DD? Maybe I should post more pictures of Carrollton.
c8cpupp	6	0	it is not always the donuts, Dunkin has the best coffee around.
c8cpw9d	6	1	Is this in Douglasville GA?
c8cq30x	2	0	Yes
c8cqebx	4	1	Hah, that's funny, I grew up down near Arbor Station. 
c8cq1oi	5	0	Woah, I live in this town. I feel like this is almost as good as getting on the news. 
c8cqvcf	5	0	O_O Another fellow Douglasville Redditor!
c8cvijn	2	0	Woah, I thought we were pretty rare. 
c8cvxbh	1	0	I thought I was he only one...
c8cn8jm	60	22	As the officer walked up to the car, I nervously rolled my window down and felt the cool air on my palmy skin. He asked me a few questions that I don't remember answering, but it seemed like I was off the hook. Then he asked me to remove my sunglasses and when I did he said," your eyes look a little red there, son. You been drinking?" Before I even realized what was happening, I heard my voice say, "No sir. But your eyes look a little glazed, you been eating donuts again?" As he pushed my head down when he put me in the back of the cruiser, I couldn't help but wonder how many beers this story would get me. 
c8cpjhx	23	2	Or this story happened all in your mind.
c8cpgea	3	3	Or upvotes
c8crnts	2	0	I'm confused as hell.
c8cokhj	11	2	Hey this is douglasville! Right off of hwy 5. 
c8cpee5	4	0	By golly you're right!
c8cplar	5	0	I like donuts too, and I'm not a cop.
c8coywy	12	4	Almost every place I've worked had a policy of giving cops free coffee. Dunkin is the weapon of choice for most people on the east coast (bc fuck starbucks) so the only reason you don't see more of this is because cops don't wanna hear people cracking g wise about it. 
c8cp7hi	8	0	And some coffee and sugar from a donut is a great pick-me-up during a long shift at anything, too. 
c8cpj7m	2	0	Except this is more commonly from local gas stations than franchise chains.  Most fast food chains I see give an average of 15-20% off to on duty officers.  McDonalds here will sometimes refuse to take their money if they just order a drink.  When going through a drivethru, not knowing its an officer to discount, will go and throw in extra food like multiple apple pies when they see the cop.  The Dunkin in town here gives 20% off to all employees of the PD, but not even uniformed officers receive free coffee.
c8cozsh	7	2	I've been to that DD, I don't expect anything more from Douglas County's finest.
c8cpiww	7	2	The whole cop/donut sterotype really makes me angry. It's like, shit, can't people like donuts and fucking coffee. I work at a convenience store and we sell both of them. Not once do I think of that stereotype when they buy it. Why? because 100 other fucking people do it as well from 7am-10am.
c8cpj7x	11	3	Jim Butcher gave a perfect explanation for this in the Dresden Series.  Police men work all sorts of odd hours. They often work without breaks or while in transit. They often desire energy and caffeination to keep them alert.  A donut (often found with coffee) is sold in stores often open 24/7.  They are quick, portable, and highly backed with fats and sugars that for an active cop who burns it off means energy.  So yeah.  Cops should prefer donuts.  They make sense. 
c8cq7gs	6	1	I work with a lot of cops, and this is truth. Where else can they stop in the middle of a shift for a quick lunch or break, where they can sit for a minute or two, and be able to run * immediately* if a call comes in?  You can't do that at a Denny's.
c8crdxg	4	2	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but:  Bleached wheat + high fructose corn syrup + soy or canola oil + artificial colors &amp; flavors ≠ Energy  More like lethargy and fatigue 
c8cp6dz	42	27	I don't understand food stereotypes. Are they supposed to be offensive? Cops like donuts. Black people like friend chicken and watermelon. There are others too. All these foods are great. I wouldn't be offended if somebody stereotyped me for liking them because I do, in fact, love them. It'd be different if I was stereotyped for eating dog shit or something. 
c8cqfri	29	4	Police officer here. I don't like donuts, but I like good coffee.
c8cr4s2	10	2	Yeah, most Dunkin Donuts customers aren't there for the donuts.
c8ct00l	7	0	Cop here as well. I enjoy donuts. Places keep giving me them for free but I always pay or just leave money in the tip jar.
c8cuss0	1	0	FRANK THE TANK!!!
c8cqdre	13	1	White people like sandwiches.    I don't think I've ever met a white person who doesn't.  
c8cqkf8	3	0	YOU TAKE THAT BACK, PASTA EATER!
c8cqj27	10	5	As a white person, I can safely say I dislike sandwiches.
c8cqk4a	7	0	...  I am amazed...
c8cr29j	3	0	Don't be. He's probably not even a person.
c8cs6m0	2	0	/r/eatsandwiches 
c8cqdpe	13	1	It's not necessarily just that cops like donuts. The stereotype legitimately came from seeing cops eating them, but with the 24 hour shifts they maintain sometimes a donut store was the only place open to get a bite.
c8cqnv8	5	1	As someone who starts a shift at 5, I can tell you that any place that offers coffee and confections before the sun comes up is a gift.
c8ctke6	35	5	As with most racist tropes and stereotypes, there is a very robust history behind the "black people love watermelon etc" bit.  &gt;Why watermelons?  According to David Pilgrim, the curator of the Jim Crow Museum, defenders of slavery used the watermelon as a symbol of simplicity.  African Americans, the argument went, were happy as slaves.  They didn’t need the complicated responsibilities of freedom; they just needed some shade and a cool, delicious treat.  Source: http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/12/26/slavery-and-the-watermelon/  [Here's more info from the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia](http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/question/may08/)  So yeah, it's not like these things just pop out of a vacuum, it's very important to look at the historical context.   As far as "cops liking donuts", I don't know where that stereotype comes from.   EDIT: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DonutMessWithACop  &gt;The reasons for this are actually not all insulting. Cops will usually consume lots of coffee, because it's necessary for them to stay awake during the night, and the donut is usually a sweet to dunk in the coffee or to remove its bitter aftertaste. Donuts are also ready-made and stored in boxes - a good food to store in patrol cars for a long time, as they don't melt or get inedible when old. They also tend to be both filling and cheap, and as Donut Shops tend to open early, for a while they were among the few places open for someone working the graveyard shift. Donut shops also tend to give out free donuts to law enforcement, partly as a public service and partly to encourage cops to hang around (and robbers to stay away).  &gt;As donuts are fattening sweets, the cop munching them will usually be a fat, lazy, moustached Obstructive Bureaucrat. (Strangely, they never get glaze or frosting in their mustache...)   
c8cupp6	8	2	&gt; According to D. P., the curator of the Wal-Mart museum, defenders of low-cost products, used minimum wage as a symbol of simplicity. Wage slaves, the argument went, were happy as slaves. They didn’t need the complicated responsibilities of autonomy; they just needed some AC and a stable pay rate.
c8cuqsn	6	1	I see what you did there and I like it!
c8crj6h	8	2	&gt;Black people like friend chicken and watermelon.  Not just black people. Southerners too.
c8csitl	7	0	And northerners. And everyone, because fried chicken and watermelon are delicious.
c8cszlr	2	0	Not just black people and southerners. Northerners too.
c8cqunh	3	0	Food stereotypes don't make sense. They are a simple correlation. Black people love fried chicken- every person in the south loves fried chicken. Every person in the north loves fried chicken. Chickens loved fried chicken. 
c8cpupr	29	25	People like to be offended, it makes them feel important or something
c8cqpzq	1	1	I don't think it's just black people, I always prefer my friend's chicken to my own. 
c8csa3k	1	0	For what it's worth, I prefer an apple fritter.  Although I would never eat one in public.  I don't like to play in to that stereotype.
c8cxh4s	2	0	The stereotype is offensive because fried chicken was (and still kinda is) seen as a poor person's food, therefore black people eat it a lot because they're all poor and uneducated, etc.  Doesn't really matter how delicious it is. That's not the point.
c8d0mfo	1	0	you say you like watermelon, and people are not going to make jokes about your skin colour being the reason why you like it. same with fried chicken. and grape soda. 
c8cp1ie	3	0	Bet they're all in there saying, "Way-o Way-o Way-o Way-o....."
c8cpz3v	2	1	It's like taking a picture of all the black people who go to Popeyes for lunch.
c8cq1b5	3	0	Hey that's my home town Douglasville. Man, glad I got out of there.
c8cq76d	3	0	Many times the donut shops are the only things open early / late for cops to get a break. In my town most officers don't get a meal break so the 30 minutes they get to drink a coffee with their co-workers in the morning is great for morale. 
c8cy086	3	0	Holy Shit! It's Douglasville, home of the Under Educated and Overstaffed Police Force Project.

c8cpvcl	1	1	I TELL YOU. Stereotypes are there for a REASON.
c8cpvne	2	0	Because they give free coffee to police officers.  
c8cpzhk	2	0	When you see a stereotype it's heavily reinforced in your brain. We never notice how often we don't see a stereotype though.
c8cq7aq	2	0	Idk about what goes on in other places, but I live in louisville and the cops here get free coffee at gas stations and, sometimes, donut places. It's beneficial for these businesses (specifically gas stations) because the cops can stick around the area and create an atmosphere of safety.
c8cq94n	2	0	It's not a stereotype if it's always true.

c8cqp8p	1	0	Lots of places offer free coffee/snacks to cops.  It helps scare off bad guys and makes the popos happy so.
c8cqr6e	1	0	You mean people who work together like to hang out at the same place? No way...
c8cqsxw	1	0	At least they backed in
c8cqt06	1	0	[Relevant](http://i.imgur.com/inmTbmI.jpg)
c8cqu8x	1	0	According to the Book of Imponderables, this stereotype all started because donut shops were one of the first 24 hours; because of this, they were often easy targets for theft and robbery.  Donut shops began offering free/discounted food to police officers because their presence helped to deter criminals.  Everyone loves free stuff and the officers were often seen at various donut establishments.
c8cqua9	1	0	My dad was a cop... he used to bring home donuts every night! Bakers loved to hook up the cops! Also, around here all the cops gather at Eat N Park
c8cqur4	1	0	Fact: A lot of cops have a sense of humor about the stereotype and consider eating doughnuts to be an unofficial tradition in the force.
c8cqvrh	1	0	The stereotype exists because a lot of donut places give cops free donuts and coffee. Also, a lot of donut places are open 24 hours.

c8cqzt2	1	0	Stereotypes do not spring and never have sprung from nothing.
c8cqzxr	2	0	While this specific instance has already been explained by the owner of the shop,  there is a pretty reasonable explanation to the stereotype.  There aren't a whole lot of businesses open when cops are working at night or in the early morning.  When it's time for a break or a quick bite to eat, they have limited options.  Donut shops open pretty early in the morning.
c8cr436	1	0	As a non-police officer, I, too, like donuts.

c8crpms	1	0	Donut shops will usually offer free or discounted donuts to cops because otherwise they would be a prime target for robberies and stick-ups. Constantly having cops there works in their favor, because them they are more secure.  So I must ask you...  Even if you aren't a cop, would you *really* turn down free donuts?

On one such ride-along, I found us rolling up to a donut/coffee shop. I laughed to myself, and the officer noticed, he looked over at me, pulled out a $100.00 gift card for the establishment and said, "You think its funny, but if you had one of these given to you every month, you'd sure as fuck use it and you know it."  He had me there.

c8cswoa	1	0	Stereotypes perpetuate because they're true often enough that people feel okay to generalize. No stereotype is always true, but they don't get started by being always false either.
c8csygg	1	0	Stereotypes wouldn't exist if they weren't true. 
c8ct0ny	1	1	The unwritten law of Reddit of states that stereotyping is bad unless it involves cops, Christians, 'Mericans, or white people. 
c8ctimb	1	0	Stereotypes also self perpetuate through socialization. The fact that cops are expected to like donuts and coffee by our society increases the likely hood that they will, in order to fit into expected norms. As well, as some other comments have pointed out donuts and coffee have a convenience factor with the odd hour job of a police officer.

c8cpcjp	97	9	I'm not a huge Star Wars expert, but I read somewhere that Mace Windu only have a purple lightsaber because his actor wanted him to stand out,
c8cprg7	89	16	Hmmmm No... It was because he obtained Hurrikaine crystals from a mission during his late Padawan years... Sheesh!
c8cqbta	64	4	Actually, Samuel L Jackson came up with the purple lightsaber idea and had it as a stipulation when he signed on to the movies. He wanted his lightsaber to stand out. Then *later* they wrote up the stuff about Hurrikaine. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_Windu)
c8cqt9o	51	2	Pfft as if being the only black guy in the prequels made him not stand out
c8cqxv0	21	1	That and I'm sure he was just running around saying mother fucker over and over again.
c8cv81y	3	1	Only black guy? Yeah right. You're forgetting about Captain Panaka. "You can't take her royal highness there. The hutts are gangstas!"
c8cw0ub	2	2	There were other black guys, he was just the most bad ass.
c8cqu17	13	0	Originally, all Sith had red lightsabers and all Jedi had blue. The blue of Luke's lightsaber clashed with the blue skies of Tatooine, so they had to use green. I'm not sure why yellow came in. I guess they just said fuck it after bringing in green and purple. 
c8cr1vf	4	0	Correct, I *believe* that they had kept to the red/blue/green scheme up until the new movies/mace windu with the purple lightsaber. Then they decided to go crazy with it.   Tangent, it's kinda like the other corps in Green lantern. For the longest time there was *only* the green lantern corps, and their rings had a weakness to yellow. Then in 2007-08 they came out with the Sinestro corps and then decided fuck it lets throw in any color we can think of.
c8cwwuj	1	0	They did have various colors in Dark Forces II,  2 years before the prequels.

c8cq8zu	14	0	pssst, you were right, he was just making a joke, or stating canon or something. his actor DID want to stand out. hence, purple lightsaber.
c8cqcb0	1	0	Don't worry, I have and didn't know the reason of the purple lightsaber until now, that's most likely from the extended universe.
c8cuutz	1	1	Yeah I was just making a joke because Samuel L. Jackson put that as a rider in his contract forcing Lucas's people to add canon to explain why they strayed from the red green blue standards.
c8cqo31	2	3	I believe he was referencing KOTOR. In it you obtain crystals to build you saber allowing for different colours and effects. 
c8cqqmr	3	0	No it's cause he's black.
c8crq1v	1	0	Samuel L Jackson?
c8cuzhe	1	0	Yup, that's him. I'm terrible at remembering actors.
c8cxhdg	1	0	&gt;His actor  You mean Samuel L motherfucking Jackson?
c8cqab0	10	1	It's obviously a grape lightsaber and that's the hint for the "g" rather than the "d" because logic.
c8cr3a2	7	4	[Naw dawg, it's just purple to match his purple drank.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/352/749/e44.gif)
c8crbud	10	3	I was wondering why this was getting so many downvotes. It's the purple lightsaber isn't it? To be honest I'm not a massive Star Wars fan so the colour of his lightsaber is irrelevant to me. Apparently this matters A LOT to some people.
c8cwgci	1	0	vote fuzzing is probably also quite a few of them.
c8cudza	3	0	The funny thing is, is that I'm pretty sure words with friends was actually made into a board game recently.
c8crbhv	1	2	Pretty sure its a yoga mat.
c8cq5cy	3	2	Otherwise known as iSketch.
c8cqbhb	1	7	I was thinking it was to make people think it is yoga as purple is for the black guy and yoda+n word= yoga
c8cp5rw	7	22	People be forgetting about Mace Windu
c8cp9hx	21	7	No, Purple lightsabers existed. They just weren't used by Yoda.
c8cpgm9	7	9	If I remember correctly Samuel L. Jackson requested to have a purple light saber, thus creating the purple light saber into the Star Wars universe.
c8cpng8	18	6	Still doesn't change the fact that yoda doesn't use it.
c8cpcl0	37	4	Good story. My wife didn't double check the word she had chosen (between Gorilla &amp; Hogwarts). She thought she chose gorilla for the easier draw, but had Hogwarts in her mind.  Anywho, she sent off her drawing of a Gorilla to our friend, and he actually figured it out, but he sent her a message "WTF does a gorilla have to do with Hogwarts????).
c8ctdqc	4	2	She rustled his jimmies
c8cp638	8	0	One time I drew garbage when the word was garage. 
c8cpcy1	38	10	Wait......people still play 'Draw Something'?
c8cpeyi	32	1	Actually I took this screenshot last year. I've only just discovered reddit and after lurking for a month I decided that this community might appreciate it.
c8cquin	20	0	Ha, and here I was thinking you were a depressed zynga employee trying to sneakily make it seem like draw something was still popular
c8cpnox	6	4	Sounds about right :-) 
c8ctcup	2	0	I actually liked this game.  The only reason I stopped because all of the people I played with stopped.

c8cssds	1	0	Thanks bro!
c8cpwq0	5	0	one time my fat fingers pressed the wrong word. so I drew a baby stroller....to indicate a stop sign
c8cr2sr	5	1	I actually was playing with a friend who just wrote "someone who doesn't believe in god" across the screen. Not only was I annoyed that he didn't bother to actually draw anything, but the word I was supposed to guess had an extra letter space and obviously was not "atheist." Turns out the word he chose was "art heist."  All my friends are fucking morons with this game.
c8cov4q	6	1	My friend had the same issue when he got "darkseid" as a word. 
c8cqrrf	5	3	If I recall that's a DC character.
c8co2e7	3	0	I did the same thing with TLC. Thought it said Tic (as in Tic Tac). 
c8coo3k	4	0	Somebody did something similar to me. Except I was supposed to be guessing potato, and they drew a tomato.
c8corx4	3	0	Why didn't you just draw Yoda with a Toga?
c8coztx	28	2	Because then I wouldn't have been an idiot.
c8cqk77	3	0	I spent a good twenty minutes drawing a great solar system for planet. My word was actually plant. 
c8crjf8	2	1	Yoda's lightsaber isn't purple.. 
c8cubg4	3	0	That is not the drawing we're looking for...
c8cpkfo	2	0	Whenever I played with somebody who wrote instead of drawing i would do this deliberately to fuck with them. If i could draw an anagram so much better. Drove them mad!
c8cq064	3	0	I had a friend draw a goatee when the word they were supposed to be drawing was Gotye.
c8cs51r	4	1	I'm guessing that now that friend is just somebody that you used to know. 
c8cqmop	2	0	TIL people still play Draw Something.
c8cqubn	1	0	I had a similar thing happen playing that game. I got so mad 
c8cr3n2	2	0	There appears to have been quite a few Yoda misunderstandings.   http://www.geekologie.com/2010/10/19/toyota-toy-yoda.jpg
c8crrkv	3	0	She's a bit small for a Hooters' waitress, isn't she? 
c8csvni	1	0	That's why it says 'former'.
c8cr696	1	0	At least you were only on a 9 streak.. I've made the same mistake up in the 200s. The other player was PISSED
c8cr876	1	1	Hah!  I was playing a friend once and he drew a stick chick with her bra in her hand. I guessed "stripped" after about a dozen failed attempts I gave up.  The word was striped. 
c8crhvw	1	0	My dad did this, he drew basketball instead of baseball
c8crozh	1	0	This happens to me more than I'd like to admit.

c8ct4gk	1	0	I love how you took the time to screen shot this, while poor margaret is in a race against time trying to find another word for what is conspicuously NOT Yoda.
c8ctbes	1	0	the same type of shit happened to me... my little sister in law drew a grim reaper with an arrow pointing to his scythe.  The word was SITH.
c8ctvdj	1	1	Yoda has a green loghtsaber. Only Mace Windu has a purple lightsaber. 
c8ctwdp	1	0	my gf sent me a drawing of a cannon and cannonball shooting out of it with red arrows pointing to the cannon ball. i ended up getting it right but the answer was cannibal
c8cu0uf	1	0	I wanna play this game so bad but I don't have a smartphone
c8cu9ix	1	0	I have drawn "window" instead of "widow" not once but twice.  Good thing I found great drawsomething strangers.
c8cug92	1	1	Everyone knows Yoga has a green lightsword.
c8cuwxc	1	0	I read Yoda as well the first time. I had to re-read it to see how you messed up there. 
c8cvbgv	1	0	My friend did the exact same thing when we were playing this game.
c8cwtq4	1	0	Another note, get the lightsaber color correct for the character. 
c8cx07d	1	0	OMG, my husband does this ALL the time.  The word was supposed to be "BAG" but he drew a "BADGE" instead.  Among other things lol
c8cxhuc	1	0	What game is that and where do i go to play it?
c8cxl5z	1	0	it's called draw something 
c8cxp7j	1	0	where can i play it at? 
c8cxwad	1	0	it's an app. You can only play it on a smart phone.
c8cy04b	1	0	Dammit
c8cywki	1	0	My sister did this. She drew a really accurate picture of the beginning of Lion King thinking she was drawing "hakuna matata". She had the word Hanukkah.
c8d0eh0	1	0	In this pic, OP is the one who screwed up… and you still posted about it to reddit… not sure if confident or oblivious...

c8cp2oq	7	0	That's why he said, "note to self" in the title. 
c8crurr	58	3	Right, your cat just put on a horse mask.  All by himself.  Right.
c8cs5gw	16	3	Don't be such a drag. Maybe he was born this way. 
c8cwbpy	9	4	You merely adopted the horse mask, the cat was born with it, molded by it
c8csfc0	12	10	maybe it's maybelline
c8cz82j	1	5	Maybe it's makeup. Maybe it's Maybelline.
c8cudi9	6	5	Although I agree that it's possible that OP set this up himself, it's really not that unlikely for cats to do something like this on their own. Cats seem to love investigating things with openings or holes large enough for their heads to fit through. My cat rummages through small boxes and paper bags all the time. So you acting like this is an impossible scenario is just unfair and unfounded scrutiny of OP. If I left a horse mask laying on the floor in the middle of the living room, I'm willing to bet either of my cats will eventually try to crawl in it, or stick their head in it.
c8cz0ej	2	1	Uses logic. Now people down vote you

c8cu7gq	2	8	Well, I figured most people on Reddit wouldn't know that the "Boston accent," spans a whole lot further than just Boston. 
c8cubgc	5	0	but it actually doesn't. there's a difference between the Boston accent and the Northern New England accent.  Even Northern Maine has it's own thing
c8cvmv9	2	0	Yeah, I lived 20 minutes from there and no one talks like that there.  We say "wicked" but it's not with any kind of special accent.  It's sort of like how people from Long Island will say something is "mad" cool, or people from California saying "hella".  
c8cwwjp	2	1	Well I guess I should've typed "New England Weighs in on Blizzard Nemo."
c8cshlw	6	1	Well at least wicked is being used as an adverb, as it should.

c8cvtcx	1	0	Yeah, please stop calling this storm "Nemo." I lived up north most of my life and these winter storms happen all the time.

c8ctheu	1	0	Not fake. See my comment other comment.
c8cy7oo	1	0	It's not fake, but it isn't from this storm.  It is a repost from over a year ago. 
c8cz5l7	1	0	Very true. From three years ago? I want to say I was still in high school at the time. I think the sign was new and they just wanted to put up something funny, and next thing you know the internet thinks it it's a riot.

c8cquwr	6	0	It's just being polite, you know like show that their words are more valuable than just a material. Unless its one of those pre written cards and they just sign their name, then I would just be like thanks for the cash :)

c8cpkil	2	1	I got a birthday card this year that was ridiculously long winded that included an ADDITIONAL long winded note (at least it was personal) that explained that a donation had been made in my name to the local humane society.  Which was a nice thought and all but yeah.
c8cq4wu	1	0	Is the humane society a cause you feel passionately about, or the giver's cause?  
c8crlt2	1	0	Neither that I am aware of.  I just lost a cat to age/kidney disease, and they decided to donate to the humane society for my birthday gift.  I mean I'm not opposed to giving money to the humane society, but as a gift it was just sort of... odd.  Not bad, just odd.

c8cpaib	3	0	People may also be surprised that it would make more sense to ask him personally than to take a picture of him and run away to post it on the internet.
c8cpdt2	6	0	But that would mean talking to another person. No one wants any of that shit.
c8cpe2s	2	1	....said someone on reddit.
c8ctkqk	2	0	NO WAY! o_O
c8cp7zg	5	2	Before Reddit there was 4chan, the original home of cat lovers.
c8cpc8g	7	1	Yeah, but 4chan consummated the love.
c8coly1	22	4	Does the typical redditor have a nice DLSR to take pictures of cats with? I would have assumed the average redditor would use a smartphone.
c8cp840	17	0	Looks like a Canon EOS 550D (Rebel t2i) with a Tamron objective. Probably 18-200mm based on the size of the objective and the distance he's on. That's basically "I want pictures that doesn't look like utter shit, and this is affordable" kind of gear. Good place to start out for someone who wants to get into photography, yet can't spend half a year's wages on gear.
c8cpfff	4	0	I think 'affordable' means different things to some people. How much would that setup cost?
c8cqa4l	3	1	About $500 for the camera, and another $150 for a low-end lens.
c8ctrpl	2	1	$150 is pretty low even for low-end lenses. 
c8coq1k	18	1	The above average redditor would buy a nice DLSR for pictures of their cat.
c8cpcth	4	0	the average redditor uses a potato
c8co7of	156	32	False; redditors do not go outside 
c8cowjt	62	10	*stare at the sun*  *shrugs*  *continues redditing*
c8cp26u	72	7	You shouldn't stare at the sun... It will make it harder to see reddit. 
c8cpyg7	5	1	Who needs the sun anyway.
c8cp7dm	13	0	oh ive seen the sun once
c8cpa5o	12	1	Was it marvelous? Or just meh? Tell us of your journeys, traveler!
c8cpxpn	5	1	The closest I get to the sun is through [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) - when I get up in the morning, having f.lux inactive makes me feel like I've done my days worth of exercise outside. 
c8cpduu	4	0	Sun? You mean the bright light that makes it harder to read Reddit?
c8cp70z	5	0	is that the big blue room?
c8cp1nq	3	0	I'll have you know I'm just about to go outside.
c8cpg9h	2	0	Hey I went outside... for like a minute... to bring my cat back in.
c8cod1c	168	27	Whilst!
c8cp5x7	21	4	your mom's a whilst!
c8cpcro	21	18	&gt;Redditor for 3 months  Not bad
c8cpf8o	18	24	Quit this dumb shit
c8cpqb5	23	5	&gt;Redditor for 1 month and 25 days  Not bad
c8cqsu7	6	2	I hate you.
c8cost4	14	20	[deleted]
c8cp9nr	3	2	Do the Australians, Kiwis and South Africans use it, too? I know there is a method to when it should and shouldn't be used, but as an American, it has always quietly been blowing my mind. Any kind souls out there willing to shed light on the situation?
c8cpcsh	1	1	There's no "method".  It's used as a conjunction meaning "during the same time that".
c8cpfrv	3	0	so... there is no difference between using while. Why use both then?
c8cplm0	1	0	"Whilst" is considered slightly more formal.  That's kind of like asking "why do the Dutch still use both 'je' and 'u'?".
c8comth	25	4	"Out  walking" how can I do this on my computer?
c8cp9ez	21	2	QWOP
c8cpe7v	7	0	Minecraft is rather scenic.
c8comhs	27	4	Reddit: It is photographers all the way up. Cat.  Cat photographer. Cat-photographer photographer. Cat-photographer-photographer photographer. 
c8cqx5o	8	1	What the hell are you talking about?
c8cssaj	1	0	Reference to this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down
c8ctlk9	1	0	Ahh I see
c8cp7s7	12	2	Maybe that *is* the OP. He had someone else take *his* picture. I'm on to you OP //shakes finger
c8cp9qb	12	1	I may have taken a picture of the cat when this fellow was done with it. Was a good cat.
c8cox9c	5	0	No, you'd know if it was a Redditor if he was abducting the cat, and saying that he "saved" it.
c8cp6xx	4	0	That isn't me, but I have that same bag. I love that bag.  Cat is also nice.
c8cnve3	26	11	ah yes, a fine specimen. observe the photo bag, ungroomed hair and tasteless footwear.
c8coryq	27	5	Yeah, but he's doing something he enjoys while not giving a fuck about what other people think. I'd say he's the winner here. 
c8coy2s	10	1	"not giving a fuck about what other people think"  You have to have something to lose before that matters. No one cares what a homeless man does either, you know?
c8cp94s	8	0	&gt;No one cares what a homeless man does either  Until he does it to you.
c8cpdmm	4	0	;)
c8cqrmr	1	0	SHOVE_IT_IN_ME: No one cares what a homeless man does either       Your reply to SHOVE_IT_IN_ME: Until he does it to you.       SHOVE_IT_IN_ME... That is all.    
c8couqr	5	3	*whilst
c8cp7jg	2	0	Everything about this picture fills me with loathing.  I think i need therapy D:
c8cpddo	1	0	clearly not a subscriber of /r/malefashionadvice. We can narrow him down!
c8cpdi2	4	0	Whilst
c8cnat5	6	3	"All right Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."
c8cnyks	63	52	Pretty sure this was posted over a year ago and OP is still a faggot
c8cpd39	8	1	Not according to [Karma Decay](http://karmadecay.com/i.imgur.com/Z12YXyd.jpg).
c8cp1zt	39	19	Of the thousands of cat pictures you likely see in a span of a mere few months, you specifically remember this one being posted over a YEAR AGO? And who's the 'faggot' again?  Just remember - when OP posts original content and is not a 'faggot', you sir, will still be an asshole.
c8cmwzo	10	5	Get your complex machinery out of my face, human!
c8cpf2p	8	5	TIL using the word "whilst" makes OP a faggot
c8cnvqh	6	3	Shooting a cat in public is a cowardly act
c8cp2mq	4	1	1) Carry a bag of up votes  2) If you see someone doing something a redditor would do  3) Throw the bag at him
c8co59e	6	6	Now if only another redditor was there to take a picture of you taking a picture of him. Reddinception. 
c8cos9w	1	0	"My cat makes this face every time i snatch some popcorn"
c8cotc7	2	0	FALSE: Redditors do not go outside 
c8cox08	2	0	not **'nuff neck beard**
c8coxkt	2	0	Well if he wasn't a redditor and just a lad taking a photo - he wont be here to defend himself against such allegations!  The only way to do so is to come online and announce he isn't, but to do that would require signing up - and thus he would become one.  Very clever OP...very clever
c8cp0qn	1	0	and you found a guy taking its picture
c8cp68c	1	1	It's likely true, many Redditors are indeed cats!
c8cp6p4	2	0	He'll be on the front page tomorrow with a bagillion karma
c8cp76r	1	1	Look at that camera and what it's being used for. 
c8cp7el	1	0	Standard redditor/photographer always hunting for karma...
c8cp7h2	1	0	Kill him and dispose of the camera.
c8cp8jk	1	0	Entry level DSLR on manual with a Tokina lens, looks like a guy learning photography to me.
c8cpgul	1	0	Looks like a Tamron to me, but still
c8cpx3c	1	0	Yep, that' s a Tamron lense.
c8cp8qy	1	0	The shoes are a dead giveaway.
c8cp91c	1	0	I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
c8cp9bt	1	0	What is the point of a cat if not to get karma? 
c8cp9d5	1	0	Why is that that dude wearing the same clothes as the person in the background?
c8cp9dx	1	0	A redditor takes a picture of a redditor taking a picture of a cat.  Guys, we got something here.
c8cpb2i	1	0	I can haz picture taken?
c8cpbjk	1	0	So you took a paicture of a man, taking a picture of a cat. You both proffit the karma and the cat gets extorted. 
c8cpbw4	1	0	The wild redditor stalks his prey...
c8cpczj	1	0	Picture coming from other guys perspective in 3...2...1...
c8cpe4n	1	0	DAE LE CATS?!
c8cpg08	2	0	He's holding his camera completely wrong. This annoys me.
c8cpg0u	1	0	I despite the way dude holds the lens barrel
c8cpgch	1	0	Looks like he might have a modest beard, but he's not wearing plastic framed eyeglasses. May or may not be a redditor.  
c8cpgwa	1	0	That's so meta
c8cpgyj	1	0	I'd say the probability is high.
c8cphxm	1	0	Hng kitties.
c8cpi6u	1	0	Looks like photographer I used to know, his initials were JPO if anyone knows this guys name...
c8cpili	2	0	The north american redditor behaves shyly when encountering humans. Good sense of hearing and a  good sense of smell helps it avoid places where it could encounter face to face human intraction.    If you want to be sure not to have an interaction with a redditor, you should speak loud and sing a song while walking.   The shy redditor will instantly identify you as an extrovert and will scamper away before you get close.  However, it is possible to surprise a redditor and actually have a face to face human interaction. Then it is good to be prepared and know how to behave.   Stay calm. Show the redditor that you did not come to identify his username. Raise to your full height and make your presence known by speaking loudly. Retire slowly and carefully the way you came – but never run away!     If you do run away, the redditor will create a post on reddit that will be sure to annoy everyone.
c8cpiw7	1	0	A wild redditor appeared
c8cpldp	1	0	Because cats amiriteguys

c8cpsq2	1	0	&gt;redditor  &gt;outside  What is this magic
c8cptdk	1	0	Loving the lowepro slingshot
c8cptms	1	0	Looks like a [Lowepro SlingShot AW series bag](http://www.lowepro.com/slingshot) - IMHO, perfect bag for walk around photography, big enough to carry your camera and a couple of lenses along with batteries, cards, etc., while still being very portable. Also love the sling design, which allows you to smoothly swing the bag from your back to in front for quick access of the camera, as you can see here, also providing you with a platform for resting/stabilizing your arms when shooting. Love this bag.  Sorry, I digress. Carry on...
c8cq1wg	1	0	Where is the picture of OP taking a picture of the guy taking a picture of a cat.

c8crrls	1	0	Is this at webster park? 
c8crv45	1	0	A redditor, taking a picture of a redditor, in the ultimate hopes of being the ultimate redditor. 
c8cs163	1	1	I have that exact camera, lens and bag.  I look like that guy from that angle.  I was scared for a moment thinking it was me.  Then I realize that I think cats are assholes and hate pretty much every single one I have ever met and felt better.
c8cs4du	1	0	AHAHAHAHAHA LE REDDITOR LOVES LE CAT HAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH MY GOD SO ORIGINAL UEIBFIEFGEGBEDIUEDPUIB

c8csxl3	1	0	That looks like a dog walking park I frequent in San Francisco.
c8cta95	1	0	Usually do not upvote posts with cats, but when I do, it is making fun of people on reddit who like cats. 
c8ctkrv	1	0	Negative, a redditor would be running away with the animal to post a new "I rescued an abandoned cat" to /aww

c8czepr	1	0	Where was this taken?

c8cp93l	19	6	There's been a few anti-whilst comments. What's wrong with whilst?
c8cpabg	2	0	I just assumed the OP was British, but either way I agree no need for the hate.
c8cqn7f	1	0	You would be surprised by how many people question me when I use whilst. I'm an American, and people look at me like I have four eyes when I use "whilst" instead of "while."   I just think it sounds more professional. :&lt;
c8cszhf	1	0	also don't take it personally if that's possible, not meant to be.

c8cofo1	4	1	Mm, Tamron.
c8cp0nc	1	0	Love love my Tamron lens on my Sony. Many reviews find it comparable to Canon L lens for a fraction of the cost.
c8cpf0z	1	0	Tamrons are a bit all over the place, really. Some models are amazing, some are utter crap. Sigma's the same way.
c8cqd75	1	0	Yeah this is the one I have: http://www.amazon.com/Tamron-28-75mm-Aspherical-Canon-Digital/dp/B0000A1G05/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360519588&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=tamron+24-75  Which I'm a fan of.

c8cmkls	11	1	We should invent Sharketball.  It's basketball, but with holes into an aquarium with sharks.
c8cmn89	21	4	with frickin lasers
c8cnngy	8	3	on their frickin heads 
c8co8wr	5	0	Also everything is dark and goes illuminated only when someone hits someone
c8cnawn	3	1	And the ball is a midget.
c8cngbb	1	0	And strobe lights!
c8cn94r	29	9	So if the Blue Whale was laid horizontally across the court, they wouldn't cancel the game?  Ok.
c8cnnrx	15	0	Also if they balance it upright on its nose
c8cnxvo	12	1	Also if you see any fucking whale at all.
c8co8ym	10	3	this is never implied.
c8codob	3	0	They would convert to volley ball.
c8coagp	1	1	We were saving that fact for next week! We don't want to overload people's minds.
c8cnwse	3	0	Alan Davies would fucking LOVE to be at that basketball game.
c8cnykm	3	0	To be fair, I think it would only take a dolphin to hold off a game for quite a while.  They're pretty strict about not having marine life (or fluids) on basketball courts.
c8co9jr	3	1	Ahh, the old reddit hug. We just want to love them, but sadly like Lenny from Of Mice and Men we don't know when to stop. 
c8cn7wv	12	4	If there is a whale of any size on a basketball court the game should probably be canceled.
c8cnq58	1	1	Oh ok, so if it laid short ways the game would move on
c8co119	2	0	It is not a proper game of Calvinball UNTIL a whale shows up on the field of play.
c8co3ls	2	0	I like the black figure with his fists in the air as if he is screaming, "Noooooooooo!" It's just one game, dude. 
c8co7xr	1	0	I can't stop laughing at the page of the player in the background. He seems so very upset that there's a whale on his court. 
c8coa7s	4	1	Reddit hug... &gt;_&gt; Anyone got a mirror?
c8cp0zw	1	0	http://rorr.im/reddit.com/r/funny/comments/188rvu/
c8coax0	1	0	I'm sure you can make that same comment about just any whale. 
c8col1z	1	0	just play around it! it's good for making dunks.
c8comus	2	0	Reddit DDoS strikes again
c8conou	1	0	while we're on the subject of basketball comics: http://achewood.com/index.php?date=04092003
c8corok	1	0	Well the website is called sad and useless. What did you expect?
c8cos1i	1	0	If it were laid shortways, everyone would be dead
c8cov38	1	2	And i never will, because apparently it won't load.
c8coz80	1	0	Here's another one. If you were to take all a man's blood vessels and lay them end to end, he'd die. 
c8coze5	1	0	If it was laid anywhere on a basketball court, I think the game would be cancelled...
c8cozpg	1	0	All right, [who stole it from whom](http://vaporheart.tumblr.com/post/42346098136)?
c8cp06d	1	0	What if we lay it sideways?
c8cp0oq	1	1	'Longways', haha.
c8cp257	1	1	The Blue Whale is the Largest Creature on Earth Ever, Take that Dinosaurs! 
c8cp4wl	1	0	 The hell I don't! LISTEN KID! I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA. I'm out there busting my buns every night. Tell your old man to drag Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes. 
c8cp5dz	1	0	If any animal was laying on a basketball court and wouldn't move the game would be cancelled.
c8cp624	1	1	There is absolutely nothing funny about this. Epic fail.
c8cp7ze	1	0	i thought the joke was the fact that sadanduseless.com was down hhaha
c8cp8uo	1	0	Unable to connect                                                                Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.sadanduseless.com.

c8cpdbr	2	0	I like whales. 
c8cq5bt	1	0	This is why i go on 4chan.
c8cqmc2	1	0	Did you know if you threw a wet, bloody tuna on the court of a basketball game, the game would be suspended?
c8cr713	1	0	I remember in elementary school they brought us all to the gym one time for some type of assembly. There was a blow up Blue Whale that was inflated to show us how big they were. It took up the whole length of the gym 
c8cr8bj	1	0	respect for the name
c8crfh5	2	0	I'm fairly certain that a blue whale laid in any direction on a basketball court would cause the game to be cancelled, or at least delayed.
c8crm0c	2	0	If you were to take both your short intestine and your long intestine and string them out lengthwise from end to end,  ^YOU ^WOULD ^DIE. 
c8csre6	1	1	this isn't even funny
c8ctmmf	1	0	The crowd appears to be racially segregated
c8cu5h8	1	1	Narwhal on the court? = Game on!
c8cvbab	1	0	 Wouldn't they cancel the game if anything other than the players and a ball were on the field
c8cwupt	1	0	Cancelled. 
c8cx75w	1	0	When I was in elementary school, the 5th grade class made a life-size model of a blue whale out of trash bags and some other stuff (unknown what the specifics were, I was in Kindergarten and only remember physically going to see the fake whale) -- it was so huge, it took up our whole gymnasium. It was the first time that I realized how small I actually was. 
c8cnu8t	4	2	*lengthwise 
c8cp51a	3	0	longways is a word in the dictionary too! http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/longways
c8co8x0	3	1	You get an upvote for making me remember a dream from last night.  Apparently I was in the ocean on the ocean floor doing something as if I was supposed to be there as a human, when someone yells "Blue Whale" only to look up and see a giant blue whale swimming by.  Thinking nothing of it until it flaps its tail to keep going and this huge wave knocks me back.   I wish I lived in that ocean world in my dreams.
c8co0g1	6	7	OK I came here to be a dick about "longways" but now I'm finding it in dictionaries... anyone else ever heard this before? Is it regional or something?
c8cowve	11	2	Simple flowchart:  Did you understand what the author meant with the word they used?   Yes -&gt; Then shut up.   No -&gt; You are allowed to express disdain.
c8cpjjg	1	3	Hmm you seem to be mistaken, b/c I understand what you mean, but nonetheless: DISDAIN DISDAIN DISDAIN
c8cokt9	2	0	I've heard it for many years, all over the US. Usually when talking to children.
c8cnu0h	2	4	Lol white guys playing basketball.
c8cmnoy	2	2	http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/180fbe/amazing_ocean_facts/
c8cnewi	1	2	I really can't find a solution here.  I think the game would *really* need to be cancelled.
c8cng0q	2	1	If there is any ocean animal on an inside basketball court it should be canceled. This would mean ocean animals can walk and the end of the world is near. 
c8cnir0	1	2	and the whale would die slowly.
c8cpbo4	1	0	And in agony.
c8cnjq3	2	1	If the whale were to be laid perpendicular to the court, however, the game would continue.
c8cogqw	3	1	Funny how the game seems to be a race war. White fans on the far side, Black fans on the near side. Just an observation 
c8cr1em	1	0	I also find it strange that there are more white players on the court haha. 
c8coxpt	1	2	Here's a down vote for your shitty title. G'day. 
c8cmubh	2	2	Why is Lebron James celebrating?
c8cmv63	3	0	He's not, he's angry. Look at his expression.
c8cnbmg	2	2	Reminds me of a fun fact Neil Tyson [posted to his Twitter](https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/228503687994155008).
c8cnfdl	1	4	My kind of fact! Hysterical!
c8co21f	1	4	Shouldn't the person in the last one be black? 
c8cp652	1	0	I see what you were trying to say there, but you should really revise the structure of that sentence in order for it to be funny.
c8co8uu	1	4	I don't find this funny but stupid, is this what they're really teaching our kids in school? Should I be cracking up? honestly this should belong in a such subreddit r/areyoufuckingkiddingme? 
c8copu9	5	0	That's just a joke man.
c8crg0x	14	3	I'm out of the loop. Why "Nemo"?
c8crjlx	12	2	That's the name of the snowstorm going on in the Northeastern United States right now.
c8crxxk	5	0	Yep, that's right. This was taken just north of New York City 
c8cy414	6	0	Then we must go to..... PLAN C!
c8cxggi	4	0	That's what I'm going to name my kid after, the storm that kept me inside fucking!
c8cv6g1	6	1	That's what anal is for
c8cwa9g	18	6	or a wire coat hanger
c8cxc66	7	0	I'm upvoting you, but I hate doing it
c8d0fa4	2	0	Anal without a condom is seriously stupid due to the high risk of bacterial infection. And it's not completely secure from semen seeping into the "wrong" hole.
c8cyquw	3	0	"Sorry for the Inconvenience" like we're talking about fucking Tylenol  for a headache.

c8cwa4x	2	0	We bought ours in a sexshop, quite a normal thing to buy when your friends turn 30
c8cw2g4	2	0	My last apartment I had a lizard that died. The problem is I'm a major procrastinator so I wrapped it in a bandana and put it in the freezer til' I'd get around to burying it. I actually forgot all about it. I wonder what they though when they found a frozen lizard in the freezer.
c8cwatd	2	0	"Hey man, you got an ice dick!"

c8czdd1	1	1	He looks EXACTLY like a fat version of me when I was a young lad.  Edited to say that I only look like him in the pictures. I was not that ugly.
c8d0jo3	2	0	The whole 'Murica thing got old a long time ago, but this is actually pretty damn funny.
c8cwupu	5	4	He actually looks more British than American.  Edit: Yes I realize he is American. Not all of us are as fucked up as him and his family.  
c8cxl8o	3	3	And not all British people have bad teeth.

c8cozgt	16	2	Reddit is 6000% sure he is not the father, Maury.
c8cp259	6	3	That's because reddit IS the father! 
c8comow	6	5	Or the other is the Reddit father.
c8consp	5	3	What's the difference between a father? One redditor is both the same!
c8crif5	1	0	OR redditors are closer together than we thought and we are getting closer and closer to world domination! WUAH HAHAHA!
c8cq4vs	1	1	Or one father was a scumbag, and saw the smiley in the sky and called up his son - hey look at what I paid for? Or maybe both were scumbag fathers, and that smiley was for some third person we'll never know about.   
c8comfm	28	9	/r/KarmaConspiracy

c8crpnk	2	0	Perhaps he has three accounts, one to "notice" the "coincidence" and reap all the karma from that too?   Eh, ihatewolves, eh eh?
c8cthi8	1	0	Or this was posted months ago after both of these were posted, and ihatewolves reposted it.
c8co812	118	23	What?  Two redditors outside on the same day?  Call /r/KarmaConspiracy .  I think they must know the pilot.  It is the only explanation that makes sense.
c8cof3g	15	6	Maybe my memory is wonky, but all three are reposts from about a year* or so ago?  (*; y'all know how remembered internet time works though)  (not that I bothered with the comments on the other two if I've missed this being pointed out already)
c8cpeqq	21	3	I actually saw this in San Diego it happened yesterday
c8co4zt	128	20	Scan the skies! Triangulate their positions! These two Redditors must meet! These two Redditors must.... kiss?
c8cp2gk	28	3	My exact response: Well, if we know the position of the smiley face, then we have enough information to triangulate the location of their houses.
c8cpjh2	9	1	*It's in the reflection.*
c8cvoe3	7	0	[I came up with about 3 miles?](http://imgur.com/YgG9h9n). This is assuming that they took the photo at the same time and the cloud didn't move. It looks like it hasn't deteriorated too much, so I think it's a valid assumption to make.   I got the angles by drawing a circle on the white board, attaching it to my ceiling and then moving away from it until i got a similar ellipse. The 12,000 ft for the height comes from the average altitude of skywriting given by [this](http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/skywriting.html) website.

c8costp	14	9	I'm getting a sarcasm reading off the charts!
c8cr7on	1	0	You don't say.
c8cnq7r	14	1	Now three redditors
c8cot1f	9	1	And the one on top got 2000 UPVOTES while the other got 5.  The end
c8cnqzh	27	5	In other news: more than one Redditor has posted that two people have posted the same picture.  I wonder if someone else has commented that 2 people have posted to state that 2 other people have posted the same picture.  Also, this has happened before you know.  Like that car on the steps photo?  Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have reposted it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.
c8co3sd	34	6	more like an aha funny not really funny.
c8cohw6	44	8	(deleted)

c8coavb	20	8	hahahahah that's really funny ROFL
c8cosnh	21	12	Really?  Nobody knows this was posted about 6 months ago?  Am I just on Reddit way too fucking much?  Yup.
c8cprks	9	0	No this happened yesterday because the San Diego padres had a fanfest at their stadium, and they took this pic: http://imgur.com/1bULWEr
c8cp9eq	14	2	This was over downtown San Diego yesterday, saw while out at lunch, and was thinking to myself, hey I should take a pic and post. But laziness wins in the end.
c8cnn66	4	0	There's so many... 
c8cnupe	3	0	Make that 3.
c8ct5af	7	5	now kiss.
c8co3vw	3	2	So? 
c8cnojs	2	0	It looked like a lake for a second
c8cnzp4	1	1	I think, they actually knew before you posted this. Frontpage is a bitch.
c8co55a	2	0	One got downvoted to hell since he was viewed as a non-OP. 
c8cob8l	1	1	Oh... They knew alright... This IS Reddit
c8cocyl	1	1	&gt;and didn't know  Well, no shit. Can you go out in the city and point out every redditor?
c8coe12	3	1	Didn't Fievel sing about this when he went west?
c8cofbr	2	0	Now three redditors posted the same thing... except one of them actually knew
c8cog7g	2	0	There was more posts from r/SanDiego
c8coxpq	1	0	I was just gonna say, whee was the super cute "G &lt;3 S" that was next to the smiley?
c8cojd5	1	0	Now they know, and knowing is half the battle. 
c8cokv7	2	0	I think i may have seen that a couple of months ago already
c8comu9	2	0	Yeah, I'm beginning to think this "internet" thing might be bigger than we might have guessed.
c8con80	1	0	And another redditor pointed it out and got a load of karma.
c8coobb	1	0	Possibru, or it could be different ones. I saw similar sky drawings at  Disney last year except he wrote:U + GOD = :) 
c8coody	1	0	Ohhh, I see, "those ones all look alike."  Racist.
c8cooqp	1	0	I think they do know considering this was already pointed out in the comments.
c8cop5e	1	1	Now triangulate their positions...and kiss
c8copit	2	0	If we can find out the altitude and size of the smiley face and the position of one of the redditors we can find out exactly where the face was. And from that the position of the other redditor.
c8coqz1	1	0	This was pointed out in the comments of both posts yet you felt the need to make your own post?
c8corz3	2	0	NOW KISS
c8cosgg	1	1	i saw the coinsidence.... but didnt bother to mention it
c8cot1l	1	0	How far are they from each other? Someone do the math. 
c8cotpx	1	1	Great minds... 
c8covfc	1	0	I want one of the posters to give his location and the direction in which he took the picture so that someone with a good understanding of trigonometry can calculate exactly where the other person took the picture.
c8covqp	2	0	Plot twist: It's the same guy but he has split personalities....
c8cows2	1	0	New season of the mentalist?
c8cowu4	1	0	I see this as becoming a common theme as we saw with OAG at the bar who took two pictures with different redditors who didn't even know they were at the same bar. As more people join more people will post pictures of the same unique events that they witness. 
c8coy84	1	0	 assume exact same time, can anyone math out the distance between?
c8coyc8	2	0	This was posted in /r/mildlyinteresting earlier (Which is where it should be) but at least there they took screenshots of the posts themselves to give credit to the original uploaders.
c8coz2i	2	0	And now you just poted both of them at the same time....IT'S THE CIIIIRCLE OF LIIIIFE.
c8cozo5	1	0	Two redditors posting the same thing isn't really new.
c8cozzg	1	0	Is OP those two redditors? 
c8cp1af	2	0	I find this /r/mildlyinteresting at best. 
c8cp1b9	1	0	They should probably have sex
c8cp1nd	1	0	Are these both still considered original content?
c8cp4gy	1	0	Two redditors posted the same thing? No, that *never* happens...
c8cp5yg	1	0	Sommmmme wherrrrre, ouuuuuuuuuttt theeeerrrrrrrrre, beneath the sky wri-tinnnnnggggggg.....
c8cp617	1	0	why should I give a fuck?

c8cp7lz	3	0	holy moly, it's my cakeday :D
c8cp7da	1	0	One redditor posted smiley face, other poster reposted said smiley face.  &gt;:[
c8cp7mg	1	0	/r/KarmaConspiracy 
c8cp8n0	1	0	And now your getting karma from it too..
c8cp8ub	1	0	It's Red John from The Mentalist! Run while you still can!
c8cp9e6	1	0	This smiley face is put up all the time over the Disney parks in Orlando. It is followed by "Jesus Loves You" or something similar. I don't know if OP is in the same location, but I've taken multiple pictures of the one in Orlando.
c8cpadd	1	0	One made the front page and the other got 2 votes........
c8cpakc	1	0	&gt;Three Redditors posted the same thing, only the third knew.      FTFY
c8cpauq	1	0	I'm pretty sure you just described the repost phenomenon.
c8cpc7f	1	0	How funny! Oh no wait. Not funny at all.
c8cpctx	1	0	Because two redditors never post the same thing.
c8cpdpw	1	0	twist the pilot who made that is also a redditor 
c8cpe1d	1	1	OPs are faggots
c8cpfpy	1	0	:) My friend also took a picture of it in San Diego, but I don't think he's a Redditor
c8cpggq	1	0	curse you Red John
c8cphlv	1	0	Yeah, several months ago.
c8cpi6b	1	0	Fucking enough of these. It just reposts a picture that already got upvoted, for no reason.
c8cpi9e	1	0	Dude this reminds of 'Red John' from the television series "The Mentalist". This is almost the exact same smile he puts near the people he has killed. 
c8cpibs	1	0	Maybe it was a love story of 2 forever alone redditors.. 
c8cpie5	1	0	can't believe I accidentally reposted the whole thing
c8cpiq8	1	0	I'm pretty sure that whenever these images got posted originally, people caught in and got the two redditors introduced.
c8cpjq9	1	0	My friend is on vacation and took a picture of this from a completely diff angle, and hes not a redditor
c8cpl1j	1	0	more than two actually
c8cpmkf	1	1	THAT IS SO AMAZING!!! WHAT ARE THE ODDS???? LIKE 1:Q9878716238716236TQEKJHS873L.IJEFKUGF  OMG OMG CRAZY WORLD
c8cpn8f	1	0	Except, one got a cloud.
c8cpo7d	1	0	So instead of linking us to their two posts, you grabbed both their photos and took your whore karma
c8cpof2	1	0	how do you know they didn't know?
c8cppg7	1	0	/r/Karmaconspiracy
c8cpt4q	1	0	They knew. Like 10 people commented and told them.

c8cpy8v	1	0	I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A REPOST
c8cpzoz	1	0	It's like that thing that happened in Duluth. 
c8cq3l8	1	0	Actually, there were 3 posts
c8cq4wp	1	0	when I saw that last night I chuckled. Points for you for pointing it out!
c8cq8f9	1	0	They know.
c8cq8zq	1	0	Ayyyy-dough-nooooo... Where's the cloud then?
c8cqcp5	1	0	OH GOD ITS CHEMTRAILS YOU GUYS
c8cqgsb	1	0	obviously the first one is better though
c8cqm7s	1	0	Where's the obligatory nerd redditors racing to use the time interval between the pics along with the degradation of the smiley face and relative angle to this landmark to estimate how far away these picture-takers are?
c8cqmyw	1	0	Now who is the bored genius who is going to figgure out how far apart in space and time these 2 photographs were taken?
c8cqoi9	1	0	Hey, Orlando.
c8cqono	2	0	Wait, there's more than one person on Reddit?  I always just figured it was 1 neck-beard talking to himself.  Guess you learn something new everyday eh!  /s
c8cqr58	1	1	/r/mildlyinteresting 
c8cqslf	1	1	there was a third redditor
c8cqt4o	2	0	This showed up in FB feed yesterday as well. http://i.imgur.com/0koQKii.jpg
c8cqzet	2	0	two redditors live in san diego
c8cr5nf	1	0	and it was posted on the MLB facebook from a baseball stadium.
c8cr8ty	1	0	wait, bs! they went outside.
c8crc70	1	0	what's more funny about this is that I posted the same thing without even knowing it D: http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/188vvg/these_redditors_might_be_neighbors/
c8crna1	1	0	Uh oh might want to take a look at my 1 account photo, for I too have seen this
c8cru4n	1	0	So...which math/physics whiz is going to tell us the distance between these two redittors?
c8cryie	1	0	WHY THE FUCK IS THIS BEING UPVOTED. HOLY SHIT PEOPLE.
c8cs2t0	1	0	And now a third Reddittor has karma. 
c8cs5rb	1	0	I would say they are probably friends, and one told the other to go outside and look, but redditors dont have friends... or go outside. So there are holes in my plot.
c8cs8b2	1	0	Two people saw the same thing in the sky in public that was visible to anyone and posted photos of it on the internet. What a coincidence. Better post it to /r/funny they'll sure get a laugh, what are the odds!
c8csdoc	1	0	This was on here a year ago.
c8cse8e	1	1	So you get internet points for posting what other people recently posted?  Downvoted.
c8cseo8	2	0	I saw this happyface over Orlando, FL last week. It said "U + God = *happy face* | Jesus loves you"
c8csg3m	1	0	[Redditor #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/187sl9/everyones_in_a_snow_storm_and_im_here_in_san/)'s big brother here to set things straight. (Feel free to upvote her post if you like the picture. She'd be happy.)  It seems that there was a [Fan Fest for the SD Padres](http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/sd/fan_forum/fanfest.jsp) yesterday. People took [pictures from all over](http://network.yardbarker.com/mlb/article_external/photo_padres_fan_captures_smiley_face_in_sky_during_fan_fest/12881326), as the winds were obviously blowing south and the smile spread from downtown San Diego all the way across the Mexico border.  She and I like to laugh about how many redditors are in our neck of the woods when we witness things like the South Bay Power Plant being blown up and tell each other, "Ooh! You should post that quick! Someone standing next to you is probably gonna get front-paged."  Neither of us is really all that obsessed about Reddit Karma, so no conspiracy here. Haha. Apparently she's better at it (and more proactive) than I am. She's been a redditor for about a month and has like 2500 karma, where I've been here lurking and commenting - and have like 41.  She doesn't have two accounts, though I don't doubt that some people would do that. Haha. And there are three of us on here with the same father. The redditor who took that pic isn't one of us. There are a few links in her thread to other pictures. One is from the San Diego Zoo (near downtown) and is pretty cool.   Anywho.... just trying to chill out the conspiracy debate and give my little sis props. 
c8csifj	1	0	And a third redditor reported both for karma.

c8crnga	188	28	Yeah...OP obviously hasn't seen many girls play Skyrim...
c8ctoex	90	14	Yeah. When I play, my brother makes fun of me for checking everything. When my mom watches she's always like "WHAT'S THAT?! GO CHECK THAT OUT."  She considers Skyrim to be mom-daughter bonding time.
c8cv7w8	24	1	I second this.  My boyfriend makes fun of me for taking so long in caves but I've gathered some pretty sweet ass armor from hidden chests.
c8cxqj0	5	0	Yep. "Hon, you can carry that!" "No mom, I don't have space, and it's only worth 5 coins." "....Yeah, but, like houses and armor and stuff. You need coins!" 
c8cxsqm	5	0	My mom gets angry when I sneak up on Draugr and kill them because "THEY WEREN'T EVEN TRYING TO KILL YOU DID I RAISE A SOCIOPATH?" but she tells me to murder innocent hunters in the woods.  I have no idea what's wrong with her.

c8cytyz	2	0	Lol that's awesome, has she ever played herself? My mom used to play Riven all the time, I think she would enjoy skyrim. 
c8czcfx	2	0	No. She has that thing where she gets frustrated if he doesn't understand things intuitively. Console gaming is something she doesn't pick up quickly.  I tried to get her to play for a bit but she freaked out and ended up running off a cliff several times before she gave up. IDFK man.
c8d0uoc	1	0	I don't know about gender equality debates, but i do know i was in a dwarven cavern for what i thought was 30 minutes turned into 4 hours. 
c8crnix	67	14	if a girl plays skyrim, she is probably also gonna search the cave fully
c8cslj7	42	27	exactly! How else will she find that one pair of designer dadric leggings?
c8d0gw3	1	0	/r/NordsInYogaPants ?
c8cp42c	113	26	That can't be accurate, Skyrim's caves are much too linear.
c8cssn4	21	4	how about Blackreach
c8cu9gj	18	4	Blackreach is a whole network of caves and can be accessed from I don't even know how many entrances. It's like a second Skyrim underneath Skyrim.  Doesn't count.
c8csnho	10	2	Depends on the cave.
c8cvgmx	3	0	Well, they're caves. A system of tunnels usually has a limited number of routes.
c8cq4m1	176	39	Can we please stop posting this now? 
c8cswch	23	8	I remember this post when Skyrim came out...
c8cwm2l	4	8	Not as long as we have reposting faggots like OP. We need a new subreddit now all the r/im14andthisisfunny assholes leaked over here.

c8ct1j9	13	43	I'd rather we just stop posting things that cause me to realize I'm always going to get along with men more than I do women.  This is why I can't have friends that are girls.
c8ctznl	26	2	Why not just pay attention to the multiple people who say that this stereotype does not apply to them.  Also, if someone's pants shopping style is a dealbreaker for friendship for you, you need to broaden your horizons.
c8cwsdx	1	1	Who pissed in your Cheerios?
c8ct6hw	3	22	TRUTH. I want more friends that are girls, but it's just not happening.
c8cwsi5	1	0	Definitely not happening. 
c8csxg2	56	13	What an awful generalization. I like to do a bit of shopping myself, and I'm a dude. (And a fashionable one, at that.) I've also killed myself many times going where I'm not supposed to go in Dark Souls, trying to explore every nook and cranny.   I'm so tired of these reddit memes that generalizes the difference between male and females. Then you have people like me who come in and whine about it! DO YOU WANT MORE WHINING??
c8ct07e	19	4	Yeah. I'm a chick, and I absolutely hate shopping. If I don't see what I want after a brisk walk straight through a store, I won't waste my time browsing. In games, however, I will waste all of my time exploring/completing everything. 
c8cwmzh	1	1	well if you don't fit the pattern then don't worry about it, however a generalization like this is pretty accurate so it's funny. Relax
c8ct7n5	21	2	TIL I'm actually male.
c8cuby9	7	2	Apparently I am as well. Go figure.
c8cuqsm	7	0	Apparently I'm female, shits crazy.
c8d10nn	1	0	Same. Actually, I'm more male than my boyfriend. I'm way better at Skyrim.
c8ctfiw	29	4	....is the joke that female gamers suck at video games or something, but enjoy shopping?  This is stupid.
c8cx06d	5	0	this is the stupidest bullshit I have ever seen in my life. Fuck you, OP.
c8cuz9p	4	2	I don't believe this implies girls suck at gaming at all. Just that they go straight to the point in games, which I haven't found to be true. It is stupid though.

c8crgwn	33	13	You have company! I do too, and I hate wandering in malls :)
c8cri4b	20	10	There's actually three of us! The only reason I go to the malls anymore is to buy new video games.
c8crkqj	34	11	Me too! This comic obviously wasn't made to entertain the females of reddit.

c8cswnh	14	22	Hi, I'm a girl and I'm sooo different too! Look at me guys!
c8ct2mj	18	3	Maybe girls aren't vying for male attention but simply trying to disprove all the stereotypes that are out there. 
c8ct9yg	1	9	Because almost every other comment here is saying the same thing without saying "I'm a girl, and.." while still proving their point.
c8cu0n0	6	2	Shut up. Nobody was talking to you.

c8cs07w	3	1	And my town doesn't even have a mall ;_;
c8ct9uk	6	0	Actually, after taking a class in college on Gaming in Society it appeared that female players loved exploration in gaming as much, if not more, than their male counterparts.  I don't have access to the course anymore, so I couldn't find the studies we used without some heavy searching sadly.  Was a fantastic class, though, and the curriculum on sexism/differences in how the sexes play games was interesting. I remember writing a paper on Joanna Dark for that section.  I'm rambling, though :&lt;
c8crq7z	10	2	Nope my girlfriend will insist on every single inch of the map being revealed before moving on with a quest in Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2
c8csu36	5	1	I'm guilty of doing this.
c8csp9d	4	3	This. My gf always takes longer to play bioshock and borderlands because she needs to find everything.
c8ct0zy	3	1	Annnd now I have to go play Skyrim.
c8ctghh	2	2	Regardless of gender, I feel as thought there is a inverse relationship to the amount of time spent meandering through a mall and the amount of time spent exploring every nook and cranny of a cave.

c8cu052	1	1	I have never spent $800.00 at the mall. I go to three stores on a normal bases which are GameStop, Spencer's, and hot topic. After that we either go home or to a movie and then eat and home. I never understood the need to buy six shirts in the same color and if it isn't broken then keep warming it. Clothes are way too expensive to constantly by them and stop  wearing a perfectly good shirt because it is no longer trendy.
c8cu6z6	1	1	Lies!  I've been buying pants from the same store for over 6 years now.
c8cuafk	2	1	Repost of LIES! Out of all my friends us females search more of any game map then any of my male friends. (obviously using my own life to judge)
c8cuas0	2	1	I find it's the opposite for me. When I go to get new jeans I know exactly which brand I like and will try on maybe 4 varieties of that brand. Then when gaming I explore every corner  of a place before going to the checkpoint/goal/etc. It drove my SO crazy when he watched me play Diablo III like that. He couldn't figure out why I didn't *just* look for the goal point.

c8cswb6	1	0	Looks in chest in breezehome 50 dragon scales and 30 dragon bones...erm I may have a hoarding problem (only been playing for a couple of week so I don't have the required smithing lvl to create dragon armour)
c8cu68o	1	0	You can probably stop hoarding them now. You have enough scales and bones to make 3 suits of armour. I wouldn't bother with Dragonplate, I didn't think it looked that great, and it's not the best heavy armour in the game (stat-wise). However, Dragonscale armour looked pretty cool and is the best light armour stat-wise.  I can sympathise with your hoarding problem. You just need to remember that most of the stuff you are hoarding will be useless to you at later levels, so use it now or sell it and buy something you actually do want.
c8cuhfb	1	0	I am thinking daedric armor is the stuff for me... it looks bad ass! (I like heavy armour)  The problem I have is selling the stuff all the prices are crap and nobody has enough gold to buy anything I want to sell
c8cvfsm	1	0	If you need merchants with lots of gold then join the Thieves Guild. Some missions give you access to Fences which usually have very large reserves of gold.  Heavy armour is great. The perk that got rid of the encumbrance penalty for heavy armour is probably the best in the game. Loads of armour, but you can still ran really fast, carry tons of loot and and swing your weapon more than once before running out of stamina.
c8cvkjg	1	0	I have that perk..... Apart from the quest where you have to infiltrate the Thalmor embasy I have always work heavy armour when going into combat(the only reason I didn't take armour on that one is I didn't realise I could... I did the whole quest with just a steel dagger and whatever I could find inside)
c8cwcio	1	0	Ouch, that must have been hard. I remember that quest because of a dragon flying around in the courtyard causing havoc. I didn't have any ranged weapons and there wasn't enough space for it to land in the courtyard... and there were loads of Thalmor chasing me.  I think my favourite armour was Dwarven. I felt like badass in that.
c8csb04	3	1	DRAUGRRGGGRGRRRR
c8crfw0	7	6	who pays $876 for a pair of pants. i explore caves like the guy in skyrim. i'm a girl.
c8cs5jl	4	9	the $876 isn't just pants, it is pants, tops, assorted junk, clothes that will never get worn, a gift for someone who she never talks to, some shitty 'designer' stuff that is a bargain because it was 'on sale' etc

c8cr074	2	11	False: most girls would probably pass up certain stores like RadioShack, Sears, GameStop etc. I'm not saying all of these but I just doubt girls would hit EVERY store
c8crcml	1	5	Forty dollars for jeans?
c8cs34y	2	7	Anytime a female is involved, I try and explore the cave as fully as possible.

It was a rather long trip, for the communities viewing pleasure and mockery" says Johan Säfström, external command at södermalm police. &gt; &gt;How excited was the police who got to sit on the scooter and steer? &gt; &gt;-"It was fun the first seven seconds, then it got kinda boring.

My parents said, fine, as long as you let the nose ring thing go.  15 years later I just recently admitted I never wanted a nose ring, I just wanted to ensure I'd get that industrial piercing.

c8cqlrg	15	3	eh, these posts are a little dumb. I mean, it really depends on the genre and style of music to have substantial lyrics. I wouldn't want to go to a dance club with songs that have deep meaningful lyrics, I just want to dance and the artists know that that is what's important.   In other words, music can have several goals; whether it be to make you dance, think, or contemplate. In most cases, a song with really simple and dumb lyrics will have a good dance-able beat, and a song with deep lyrics will focus on a simpler melody so you can listen to the lyrics. 
c8cxa2n	4	0	I agree with you in a different sentiment: There are some styles of musics/genres/songs/artists that are only worth listening to for the sound. The lyrics in some are just part of the sound, and don't necessarily need to contribute to a separate message.

c8cwmbw	3	1	no, it's the face belonging to the Sphinx. Therefore it is the Sphinx's face.
c8cyd64	2	0	In that case it's missing an article.
c8d0a35	1	0	No, you don't use apostrophes for plurals. Sphinxes is correct because it's the object of the sentence. The work is being done to them by the auto-blur.
c8d0iv6	1	0	But there is only one Sphinx, and the face in question belongs to him, therefor it could well mean to be possessive.
c8d0qc8	1	0	Then you would have to say something like *Apparently Google maps face auto-blur works on **this** sphinx's* or *Apparently Google maps face auto-blur works on sphinx's face*  The possessive can't make sense here without adding more words. Read the title out loud; it seems OP tried use an apostrophe for a plural when he really meant to say sphinxes.

c8coun5	429	99	People who have something to do with adoption are *really* touchy for some reason. So are deaf communities, for different reasons.  Don't really give a shit about them if they can't take a joke. Ever time they balk, I beat my adopted child. It's okay. He's a ginger. 
c8cp68j	69	17	I go to a school with a large deaf population. phrases like "hearing impaired" are considered offensive to some apparently, because they imply there is something wrong with the deaf. Also, some look down on deaf that get cochlear implants, for similar reasoning
c8cpu8b	166	19	Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there something wrong with deaf people?
c8cqmqh	143	17	"I think there's something wrong with your car. The windows won't roll up."   *"There's nothing wrong with my car. It's just society that says windows have to roll up. Bigot."*
c8csijv	15	2	from what i understand thats actually not that far off. they dont see them selves as disabled, just different. the windows arent broken, theyre just a model built to intentionally not have windows that roll down. something like that at least
c8cvano	6	0	Yes with enough cognitive dissonance you can make an argument for anything. The standard model human is a hearing creature, not being able to hear has obvious drawbacks, anyone saying otherwise is lying to themselves for whatever reason, but they are not rational.
c8cyb96	1	0	true, but what if someone had night vision... would there be something wrong with them? or with everyone else? lol

c8cq7p4	35	10	Of course not! Everyone is just a different snowflake; we're not made from molds and should not be measured by some arbitrary standards that society flippantly imposes on us!  I wonder what's so bad about admitting your defects. Alright, society, I have a short dick, so fucking what.
c8cqdpr	11	3	no, i think he means the whole "they can't hear worth shit" thing. that's something "wrong" with them. not them as in the person them, just them as a functioning person. not a functioning person as in societally, but as in functioning perfectly as a human being.
c8cqi6c	12	2	I think you missed my point.
c8cqj1v	15	2	is your point that you have a small dick?  edit: i mean this in a joking way.
c8cripx	7	0	That's probably why you missed it...pretty small point.
c8cqkvv	3	2	Partly. You covered the other part.  &gt;no, i think he means the whole "they can't hear worth shit" thing. that's something "wrong" with them. not them as in the person them, just them as a functioning person.

c8ct66p	3	0	Increasing pressure on sensitive areas is more pleasurable than repeated shoryukens to the cervix.  
c8cqf4e	2	3	It's only a defect if you ascribe yourself to society. Wouldn't you rather be a whole and perfect being in an alternative society versus a "defected" being in the popular one?
c8cq751	2	0	You are briljant
c8cqoaz	1	0	They can't hear.
c8cuvfg	2	1	Yes there is.  I will never understand this. I have a physical impairment. That is literally what it is. By definition one of my arms does not function normally. This shit is so ridiculous in every aspect.   You mainly see it on reddit with transgendered people trying to convince you that society/science is wrong about male and female, and that they are normal. It's comfortable lies.
c8cp9xz	28	7	Deaf people have essentially formed their own subculture. It is true that those who get the implants are looked down upon. It's very interesting really.

Don't be so fickle, reddit.   I'll have you know my sandwiches are to *die* for. If you thought I was serious than you should learn to read context. 
c8cphem	42	7	Meh, couldn't care less. I'm just assuming everybody is a woman for a week to see how it goes.

c8cpmvr	4	0	If it's obvious they don't know your gender, then consider it a gender neutral pronoun.
c8ctycc	1	0	Generally I find "man" the more neutral pronoun. Everyone belongs to Mankind. We are a race of Men. "She" only applies to women.   Not that I really care. It was just a set up for a joke. 
c8cpr7c	5	2	So we're just supposed to *assume* you're a guy by default? Don't be silly
c8cqgw9	8	0	Oh man, I know a chick who was adopted. She is a little loony. She so anti adoption it's insane. Any mention of adoption makes her livid. Mind you, the woman who adopted her was a great mom who she loves and treated her great. She met her birth mother who sounds like a train wreck. But she claims that she would have rather been aborted than put up for adoption. 
c8cqbey	6	0	Eh, there's people *everywhere* that are really touchy about anything you can think of. You just can't win 'em all, so why bother.
c8crm7q	3	0	Nowadays, it seems like people just like getting their panties in a bunch.
c8csc68	4	0	God...  This reminds me of when Portal 2 was released, and there was that news story about an enraged father who had adopted a child, and he was mad at all the adoption jokes that GLaDOS would make throughout the game.  I never really realized how touchy adopted parents were until you said that and I remembered that BS.  I remember feelings sorry for the girl.  She was just sitting there playing the game, probably didn't think anything of it at all, and then all the sudden her parents turned it off and started making a ruckus about it, going as far as to *put it on the news.*  WTF.  Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUQYrdgIJuI  Edit: What's worse, this is a perfect demonstration of how the media can spin absolutely anything.  They touted Portal 2 off as a "kids game" because it was rated "E," and then they were all, "Did you hear that? That character is *taunting* another character for being *adopted*!  And this is a *kids game!*"  Man, sorry, this always causes me to go off into a rant...  The sheer stupidity of the whole thing is just mind-numbing.
c8cu4hr	2	0	This incident is what partially inspired me to write the post.   I do feel bad for the kid. If the parents didn't project their discomfort, nothing would have happened. If you're in the care of a loving family, there's nothing wrong with adoption. There's also nothing wrong with adoption jokes.

c8cuyfq	1	0	Yeah, but maybe deaf people are just paranoid because they can't tell what you're saying when you turn around.
c8creip	4	0	I'm adopted and I think it's fucking hilarious.
c8cty5j	3	0	me too buddy, me too. Adoption was probably the best thing that ever happened to me, took me from a "mother" that was a homeless, prostituting, IV amphetamine addict, and into a home with two loving parents and an awesome brother (also adopted).   Every time I think about my adoption I thank the Fates for giving me a good life.
c8cpuke	30	3	Being adopted myself, this joke made me laugh harder than anything else in the entire movie.  That, and Hulk's ["puny god"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unKcLqtrvjw) moment. 
c8ctp9t	2	0	hulk's puny god moment was my favorite part
c8cruac	2	1	It's a funny joke and I like it.    But obviously adoption agencies spend their time trying to find a home for kids who - through no fault of their own - do not have one.  It's fucking heartbreaking what some of those kids go though.    Lots of people don't want to adopt because they assume all adopted kids will grow up to be mass murderers or some such.  Lots of why they assume that is because of movies/media that play up that stereotype.  It upsets them because they want kids to find good homes and don't want folks to be biased against adopting.    I agree that it is a funny joke and yes, they are sometimes a bit uptight - but honestly it sucks to watch innocent kids get screwed because nobody wants them.  Their concern is coming from a good place.  
c8cqnzj	6	2	As I recall, Thor didn't know that he was adopted because it was a secret between Odin and Loki about him being a [spoiler](/s fucking frost giant)  It's in the link url dammit because I don't know how to use a spoiler in this subreddit. 
c8crqnf	10	0	Can't find a link, but in Avengers when Thor first appears and talks to Loki on that mountain thing, Loki says something along the lines of "I assume our father told you about my *real* parentage," or something like that.

c8cqykk	5	1	He did not learn it, he fought his brother, but he was never informed that he was a ... anyway. [Thor was never told, all he knew was that he was lied to by his brother who tried to over-throw the government and then tried to destroy yodenheim with the bi-frost which Thor destroyed.](/spoiler) (thanks LOBM for the spoiler info)   Also, this is why instructions on how to post spoilers in the sidebar would be helpful. 
c8cr83w	14	0	Pretty sure it can be assumed that Odin told him between the movies.
c8crokg	2	8	[deleted]
c8cu9t5	3	0	I would think it would be difficult not to tell Thor if he were to inquire why his brother suddenly went rogue and attempted to kill him. Besides, wasn't he setting Thor up to take over for him anyways? He earned his stripes back when he got his hammer back. Its kind of important to let your up and coming King/Son know everything if you really want him to lead correctly.
c8cv8l8	1	0	All of a sudden? Loki tried to kill him and Odin, I would think that might raise some questions, perhaps along the lines of "WTF was all that about?".
c8cr8z8	1	0	Some subreddit's use \[TEXT HERE](/spoiler). *Some*. Markdown does not have a spoiler syntax and Reddit admins have not added it.  But /r/funny does use the above: [TEXT HERE](/spoiler)

c8crnwt	7	1	No, but you're missing an m.
c8cqumj	5	2	I'm not sure either, is it funny because Thor's trying to distance himself from Loki embarrassingly low kill count?
c8cuhql	2	0	Initially he Thor was not exactly defending Loki, but took exception to harsh language directed at Loki because they're brothers. When confronted with the reality of what Loki had done, he wanted to distance himself by saying Loki was adopted. 
c8crrxv	3	0	Loki, according to legend, was really adopted.
c8cqu99	1	2	I'm missing it to.  It makes 0 sense to me
c8cqvls	6	1	This is true.  I saw 21 Jump Street with my brother and I was the only one in the theater who laughed at the "4th wall" type jokes.
c8cog7u	44	13	By far my favorite joke in the movie.  Mostly because I have an adopted sibling who is a sociopath.

c8cu6qs	1	0	His hair is so much better than hers. I find that fact very amusing.
c8cufk5	2	0	I'm guessing a lot of touchiness stems from the same flak that the movie Orphan got. It's obviously a broad stereotype of adopted children with a tendency towards acts of sadistic violence.  I guess I'm trying to help people make sense of it, because my little brother and sister are adopted, and they're currently going through major abandonment issues. Essentially, they are trying to convince themselves that they are inherently bad, because they were abandoned by their birth mother.   While obviously, that isn't true, they're 11 years old, and can't really put into words why they feel this way. They've told my parents that yes, they sometimes wish that they weren't adopted. But it's not intended to hurt my parents, but to make them aware, that they are feeling the hurt of being abandoned.  It also may be fair to point out that this wasn't just being put up for adoption. Due to some of the traditions of their tribe, since they were 1) twins 2) born out of their tribe, they were abandoned to be eaten by wild animals.   I laughed when I saw this in theaters. But I can understand why some people are getting angry about it. It's a subtle interjection of everything that adoptive parents are trying to convince their kids that they aren't. They're trying to convince their kids that there isn't something inherently wrong with them that caused them to be abandoned. And then to see something like this in a popular film could hurt them.

c8cp5db	7	15	Do you also don't get it or are you joking? 
c8ctdne	1	2	Probably because it isnt funny
c8cr7ne	2	8	What a bland joke. In your mind is this actually funny or something?
c8corwj	4	13	Never understood the joke. Who were the 80 people Loli killed? I only saw him physically kill a few agents. Is Black Widow just dumb?
c8cp2ye	8	1	He was the proximate cause of the desert research facility's destruction, never mind his personal explosion of several cars and a helicopter on the way out.  Granted, they were trying to evacuate the place before it collapsed. But a facility that large doesn't empty out easily. Given his general attitude, it would also not be surprising if he killed more people in the days it took to pull the Avengers team together. 
c8cp2lf	5	1	They died offscreen. Duh.
c8cqhzz	3	0	I missed the part with the loli.
c8csbmv	2	0	Haha I mistyped :P I'm not saying I don't like the joke, I was just always confused with Black Widow's response. 
c8cq77v	2	2	Thats so weird, I was watching it this morning out of the blue and I pointed out the same line to my girlfriend.
c8cqwrm	2	2	I actually hated this joke. It just seemed so forced and cliche coming from a movie that had so many funnier jokes throughout. 
c8covn4	9	24	I am like the only person who thinks she looked awful in this film. This shot shows why.

c8cqiam	1	4	I simply think it was an overall bad and terrible movie with over caricaturised characters. we all have different opinions.
c8cqqjd	2	0	Sure, but don't try to justify your opinions with BS.
c8coth6	1	12	[deleted]
c8coyjf	16	0	It was extremely hinted in the movie and thats what the movie was based from.
c8cp2xq	21	2	In fact, it's explicitly stated in Thor. He's an ice giant who Odin adopted and raised as his own son.
c8cphyc	9	2	Loki was of Frost Giant decent in the actual Norse mythology. He and Thor actually hung around quite a bit, Thor usually having to bash his way out of messes Loki got him in. After Loki caused Hodr to accidently kill Baldr, the Aesir realized that Loki was no longer the lovable scamp they thought he was, but turning more and more malevolent and evil. Eventually they strapped him to a rock with one of his son's intestince and put a viper to drip venom on him until Ragnorok.  Also, did you hear about the time Thor almost drowned in a river of Frost Giant menstrual blood?  Fucking vikings, man.
c8cpweg	5	1	To expand on this:  You know earthquakes? Yeah, that's Loki writhing in pain as the venom drips onto his face.  Dead serious.
c8cpyhr	4	1	Norse mythology is so much more fun than Hebrew mythology.
c8cqg74	1	0	Norse mythology is so...depressing. It all leads to death. I need some Elysian fields in my life. 
c8cqpcr	3	1	There's still rebirth after a glorious battle to the death. It's not all slow and painful and stupid like the Jesus ending.
c8cpy66	1	0	There is also the whole Loki getting raped by a horse, becoming pregnant, and giving birth to the horse Odin uses.

c8co7xa	140	24	It's great that the OP chose the title with the most upvotes and copied it...exactly. Good thinking.
c8cofoq	74	12	&gt; copied it...exactly  False.  OP's has 5 periods in his elipses, but the top post had 8.  Op's "what" had 5 "A"s, but top post had 8.  He also added a space after the "what" and added an extra question mark.

c8cp5vm	13	2	I've never reposted, but I wonder if we can just maybe automatically run this analysis whenever anyone makes a post, and if there's reposts, we can interrupt the person with this information just before they hit the final submit. At that point, they've been "warned" and you'd get less reposts from people backing out, or possibly more relevant reposts, as people are now well aware that this is clearly a repost.  Then, when the item is published, you can add a small link that says "8 previous reposts" and clicking that will show this table again. Sunlight is a great disinfectant.

Just appreciate the funny and shut the fuck up!  Thank you.

c8ctx5v	2	1	well, i'm glad somebody enjoyed my post. at least this guy gets 900+ karma for posting a less funny version :/

c8cr4yz	9	0	This reminds me of a story...  My grandfather was the only doctor in a small town in the Adirondack Mountains in upstate NY, so he would get strange cases from all over the area. One time, a farmer came into his office complaining of what sounded to be gonorrhea. My grandfather took a look at him, and after running some tests, realized that the guy did in fact have the clap, but it was a very strange strain that looked different from the usual disease. My grandfather then proceeded to ask the guy questions about where he thought he could've gotten it.  It turned out that this farmer, in order to get back at his farmer buddy, decided it would be a good idea to fuck his buddy's prized milk cow, Bessie. Unfortunately, it seems Bessie had the bovine version of gonorrhea, and the farmer hadn't used protection, so he came down with a case of cow clap.  TL, DR: My grandfather once treated a guy who got the clap from a cow.

c8cnsvf	28	9	4 months in jail and the only charge was public lewdness?   That is fucked up.  Nobody should go to jail for just being lewd in public.  A fine will do.  That punishment is seriously to heavy for the reported crime.
c8cplho	15	2	Think that's fucked up? I've heard of people who urinate at a park (public urination is normally a ticket) but because it's a park, even at night, they are now sex offenders. 
c8cwr37	4	0	I know a guy like that too.  Now he works as a dentist's assistant.
c8cr0du	4	0	I would think he should be charged with animal abuse.
c8culhp	5	2	Seriously man, he's a sick bastard. You don't stick your tallywhacker in an animal and think it's justified because it didn't respond negatively. That's straight up abuse.

c8crn16	4	1	How is four months in jail going to help this guy at all? As if getting raped and/or beaten is somehow going to make him *less* inclined towards bestiality in the future? Send him to some sort of psychological / educational program.

c8cmdi1	5	1	In Texas, it violates the "public lewdness" statute if it is done in a public place, but, if you have sex with an animal in the privacy of your own home, you are free to go--unless prosecutors can allege that your conduct caused injury, serious injury, or constituted "torture". In that case, you could be charged under the general animal cruelty statute. Only in America!!
c8cnb7y	2	1	Is that what they mean by "Freedom"?
c8cmeh6	4	2	Jesus, Texas. Get your shit together.
c8cnux0	2	0	Can he be charged with rape if the horse did'nt agreed?
c8co9om	5	2	Why? Before you get all aggro bible thumper. Have you ever seen a horse weiner? They are freaking HUGE. Your little millimeter peter did nothing to the horse. That horse didn't even know. I wouldn't do it out of cleanliness reasons.  The horse felt nothing. I assure you. Because horse can run... and it didn't.
c8com3v	4	11	Human beings should know better, before you get all furfag zoophile apologist on me. That's taking advantage of an innocent and non-consenting life form. That's like saying it's okay to jerk off on babies because you can just wash them off and they won't even remember it.
c8cpd8i	8	2	Babies can't respond or fight back. A horse can kill you quite easily if it dislikes what you are doing. That analogy is absurd and sensationalist.
c8cs6lf	1	1	So.... are you one of those people who are against hot girls having sex with consenting male dogs?  Just curious.
c8cpejo	2	0	Pretty sure in another article, it stated that he committed suicide.   I'm sure he's "Yiffing in hell" as you folks like to say.
c8cuy8z	2	3	I can't believe some Redditors think it's okay to rape an animal just because they might not have felt it. If a woman had passed out after drinking at a party and some guy rapes her, is it justified because she didn't feel it? You'd never say that. If she didn't consent, it's rape. An animal can't consent. That's animal abuse. Whether she can or can't feel it doesn't justify it. I'm sorry for your downvotes man, I upvoted you because you're right. He's sick. Perhaps saying he should be exterminated is a bit over the top but four months is ridiculous. He should spend so much more time in prison for this abuse.

c8d0li5	1	0	I hate it how the national chains are using the word 'store' instead of 'shop'.

c8coz9x	96	8	As someone who always does this to people who wear glasses, I thank you for pointing out I'm a complete idiot
c8cq0x2	8	2	put up 3 fingers but hold down your pinky, keep the middle and ring finger together. It's a better test because the two fingers will blur together if their sight is bad enough. 
c8cqj4z	16	0	And if their sight is as bad as mine and they're far enough a way, the fingers end up blending with the background so you can't even tell if they have fingers held up or not.

c8ctmd2	4	0	Yes. 
c8cp2wj	10	0	to be perfectly fair, if you get far enough away, everything is blurry.  I have something like 20/800 vision, and without glasses or contacts, anything past like 5-7 feet is just a blob.

c8cw5xq	1	0	vamanos vamanos!
c8cskdl	1	0	This, the point is to put all your fingers together so that you can see whether you can differentiate the fingers being held up. The picture is wrong because the fingers are spread apart.

c8cwvjg	1	0	Sometimes I trade glasses with my fellow near-sighted friends and get this reaction from them. Behold, I am super-blind! Bow before your sightless leader! I shall rule you all... until someone with a cane and a dog shows up, then I'll go stand politely in the back.

c8coo95	3	0	that's seven fingers and a green thumb, you must be good with female plants
c8cq7a1	3	0	I have a fairly bad case of keratoconus, which means the outer shape of my eyeball is fucked up. When I'm not wearing my contact lenses, I genuinely see 6 fingers on my hand-- depending on how I hold it out in front of me.  My non-expert explanation of this: My left eye alone kind of has a distorted view producing the image that I see in 3 places (I actually only need one eye to see triple). Generally the brain does a lot to somehow make sense of blur of images- and for the most part it does it well. But when I hold my hand out at arms length with the palm down, somehow it "fixes the image" to provide me with 6 fingers.
c8cv27o	2	0	keratoconus buddies!
c8cr6vi	3	0	That's why the best response is, "Seven, you inbred freak."
c8cn3fh	4	1	I use reading glasses, and people always ask me how shitty shit looks without them. It looks the same, but if i have to sit somewhere and read a book for 2 hours without them i get a headache.
c8cp2ez	1	0	I can see close-up(like within 3 or 4 feet) perfectly. But anything past that is too blurry.
c8cquwz	1	0	What's it like, having bad vision? I can't imagine not trusting my own eyes for anything. 
c8cr6id	3	1	Well, like I said, everything within a certain distance is fine. After that it gets blurry. Things just get less sharp and defined.  Personally, my vision isn't really *that* bad. I could get around fine without my glasses. I just have trouble reading and everything is kind of fuzzy and out if focus. It feels way better to be able too see everything normally though.  It's funny. When I first got glasses and started looking around at people, I was like DAMN! You're all way uglier than I thought! Haha, when your vision is blurry, it's hard to notice small imperfections on people's skin. So once you put on glasses, it's like mind-blowing!
c8cr77a	2	0	Wearing glasses or contacts brings your vision back to normal, its just that second or so in the morning where you have to squint at the clock or in the shower that you even notice. 
c8crk1w	2	0	Yes. And then when you take a shower with contacts in it feels SO WEIRD because you're just used to not being able to see clearly in the shower. 
c8crxo9	2	0	Huh I've never worn contacts but that would be weird 
c8cs8w0	1	0	Contacts are pretty nice to have (I usually use them when I go boating, dress up, or use them for work) but they take some getting used to and if you get up early, it sucks poking your eyeballs when you're waking up.   But yeah, it's nice that your world isn't in a "frame" in a way and no matter how much you move your eyes, everything is still in focus. 
c8cssi1	1	0	When I got lasik years ago, taking a shower the next morning was the weirdest thing. Also, swimming. 
c8ctyll	1	0	Very jealous of you right now. I really wanna get lasik but sadly my prescription hasn't stopped changing yet (mine gets worse by about a quarter to a half diopter a year) and last I checked the procedure was still pretty pricey.   Maybe someday in the future though, I am still pretty young. 
c8cujym	1	0	Don't be jealous. For some reason, it didn't last for me. A few years after I got lasik, my eyes started going bad and now I wear glasses again. My vision isn't as bad as it was pre-lasik, but I still can't see well enough without glasses. :(
c8cutsy	1	0	You don't really distrust your eyes, since they simply aren't giving you any well-defined information in the first place.  If you go around without glasses or contacts, you end up adapting; getting close to anything to read it, inferring what things are based off of color, general shape/size, and location.  For example, it is difficult (if not impossible) to read a billboard by the side of the road, but you can still cross the street with no trouble.
c8cu1q6	1	0	i can see within 3-4 inches :(
c8cv5nw	1	0	Without contacts I can just about see okay to the tip of my nose.
c8covbo	1	0	I can't tell you how many times I've had to guess how many fingers once I take off my glasses
c8cr3p7	1	0	So true.
c8crsej	1	0	you actually have friends without glasses? do these people even exist anymore? i'm pretty sure they're just wearing contacts.
c8crt6r	1	0	My trick: Hold up 4 fingers, ask. Hold up 2 fingers, ask. Flip them off, ask. 
c8crxh2	1	0	Title to picture ratio is quite bad
c8cs3kf	1	0	How I see without my glasses vs. how I see on DMT.
c8ct3pa	1	0	Things get blurry at about 7 inches for me, I'm 23, I'll probably be blind one day.
c8ctmme	1	0	Or they think without glasses you are blind and can't see anything at all. 
c8cto57	1	0	To be fair, the blurriness of my vision kind of manifests as seeing a whole bunch of the object in question all clumped together. So, like, if I look at a crescent moon, I'll see a sort of pointy-edged haze, and if I squint, before the haze resolves into a single moon, I'll see, like, seven moons all right near each other. The hazy hundreds will condense into a dozen and then a few before I can see only one. Does that make any sense?  Tl;dr: I have no clue how many fingers you're holding up. :/

c8ct4gd	2	0	Without his face I wouldn't have known it was him either. His face is distinctive. And the fact that Samuel L. Jackson has been in numerous Tarantino films. In other words, there is really no excuse to not know who Stephen was. Looks like Sam, talks like Sam, Tarantino film, probably Samuel L. Jackson.

c8cn4bg	9	4	What was the deal with him (Stephen) hovering over Monsieur Candie anyway. Even while he was eating? I've heard of house butlers, but this was weird..
c8co46h	19	1	**SPOILER OF COURSE**   My theory is that he is actually a pretty well respected advisor of Candie, but he acts like a stereotypical "house nigger" around guests and other staff. Candie isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but obviously wants to be seen as educated, cultivated and smart^[1]. When Stephen and Candie are alone in the library, Stephen talks, sits and behaves normally and Candie listens carefully to what he has to say.  ^[1] like being francophile, but not speaking a single word of french or knowing who Alexandre Dumas is
c8czinf	1	0	Ok, so it wasn't just me. I was all *why the hell is he completely different/sophisticated in this scene?* meanwhile in the dining room he reminded me of Planet Of The Apes. [totally racist whatever but that's honestly what I was reminded of]

c8cp2fk	4	0	Because the best way not to get your ass beat is to make sure you know what the boss in thinking. Not to mention Mousieur Candie was a idiot, and Stephan pretty much ran the farm with Candie as the figure head.

c8cmao6	110	19	I bet the guys took off their dress shirts after the prom. To be all sexy-like, ya know.
c8cmgsi	136	17	Yeah, girls *hate* it when guys are wearing nice clothes like suits &amp; shit.
c8cmqgs	50	18	To be fair, if they're wearing a tie that top button **should be fastened.**  So many kids just end up looking like douchebags these days even when trying to dress up because they wear their ties loose and don't button up.  They also usually go for something lazy like the four-in-hand and I personally just don't like how it's asymmetrical.  Go for the symmetrical half-Windsor since it works well with the same fabrics.
c8cmvqu	47	7	The half Windsor is not symmetrical. It's close, but only the full Windsor offers true symmetry. 
c8cn02i	28	4	Yeah, but it's also about as wide as your entire neck.
c8cn34g	25	3	Whoa whoa whoa... I must be lost. is this r/Funny or r/MaleFashionAdvice?  This was actually a legitimate question since I subscribe to both...

c8coxdi	1	1	Not if you pick the right width tie for it. If the knot is as wide as your neck, you're obviously doing something wrong.
c8cvnr5	2	0	There's a chance he *may* have been exaggerating.
c8cvstj	1	0	I know.
c8cn847	3	0	Half windsor for the win. The asymmetry looks more complete than a full windsor.   It's like complaining that Picasso didnt make his art realistic enough.
c8cq06n	2	1	THANK YOU. Full Windsor is the way to go.
c8ctgpm	1	0	Agreed.  My own personal preference for the half-Windsor is that the full one doesn't work with certain collar types due to its size and also because I am a tall person that would never have enough length on a normal sized tie to pull off a full-Windsor.  Though I try to use tall ties when I can, so in those cases it works fine.
c8cvn05	1	0	It's a hell of a lot more symmetrical than the lazy-ass looking four-in-hand.
c8cn3t6	12	4	Wait, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that it was a legitimate style choice to have the top button undone and your tie **slightly** loosened? I mean, you may need to re-evaluate your priorities if you're determining that someone is a douchebag based on how many buttons they've buttoned.
c8cn7bp	8	3	Style choice maybe, but anyone who does this looks drunk.
c8cvoi2	3	0	ANYONE WHOS STYLE CHOICES ARE DIFFERENT THAN MINE HAS MADE THE WRONG STYLE CHOICES.
c8cp9je	4	1	Or they look like they're under 40.  There's absolutely no point in being uncomfortable in order to demonstrate dedication to looking professional, and younger generations have realized that.    Personally, I'd rather not be choked while I'm at a meeting just to prove a point to elderly businessmen.  I let my work do the talking.
c8cvpsc	1	0	I agree to an extent, but I still wouldn't unbutton the top button at a business meeting. I see it as an acceptable going-out-after-work look, but not while at work. I mean, if there's  &gt;absolutely no point in being uncomfortable in order to demonstrate dedication to looking professional  then I might as well wear sweatpants and a beater to work.
c8co1z7	1	1	If the collar is really bugging you undue the top button but tighten the tie as much as possible. Collar extenders look and feel crappy.  Banana Republic tried pushing the top button undone while I worked there. In my opinion it was because they only sell shirt sizes (S,M,L,ect) instead of offering different neck and sleeve sizes. If your customer had a large neck you told them the top button undone was "in style".

c8cm63t	10	4	I'm trying to figure out the scene. Girl in prom dress, limo, one guy in a wife beater, and some half naked black dude. This is one serious porn scene about to unfold. 
c8cm1lf	26	14	if I was that girl's parents, I wouldn't even be worried about the black guy. my daughter has her prom dress on, her date has his prom tux half off.
c8cmjw6	39	8	Why should we be worried about the black guy in the first place?
c8cmxua	7	0	Probably just because it's a prom and he had no shirt off and isn't dressed for it and he looks pretty crazy. 
c8cmlh3	44	13	Black men are required to rape one white woman each year to prove that they are still fit, and not a burden to the rest of the black community. If they fail, they are put on an ice floe and left to drift out to sea. This way, none can become a burden.
c8cmlsd	26	4	You might be wrong, but I don't know enough about black people to dispute that.

c8cmhmp	9	3	My white family adopted a 10yo black child when I was 6.  One time we were playing hide and seek at night and I said "Kenny, you can just play with no clothes on and no one will see you."  He got VERY upset with me and didn't speak to me for days.  I thought it was harmless, but there are many times that I put my foot in my mouth like that. 
c8cms5s	5	2	That's tough for both of you. I'm curious, how do you two get along these days?  If he had the opportunity to experience any sort of racism prior to the adoption (highly likely) he was particularly sensitive... Especially having been brought into a new home. And 6 y/o you undoubtedly just wanted to have fun and couldn't understand why that would bother him at all. 
c8cneb2	4	1	Let's see...  He ditched the family 15 years ago to move back to Texas to be with his original family.  I found him on Myspace a few years ago and had eggshell conversations.  Our mother's health was deteriorating, so I asked that he call her on mother's day.  He promptly blocked me, and ignored/blocked all further attempts at communication with him.  Fucked up thing is, he is my big brother, since I was 6.  Right in the feels, you know?  I should do an AMA about the whole foster family that my family ran for a few years.  What a mindfuck. 
c8copq3	1	0	I'm so sorry to hear that. :(   You tried. That really sucks. Hopefully his life will balance out and he will learn to appreciate (or show appreciation) for your family's contribution to his welfare. Good on you for keeping him in mind. Hopefully you're not too scarred and are having a good life now.

c8ckefh	166	23	The LAPD were looking for a grey Nissan Titan owned by an alleged murderer Christopher Dorner. However they mistakenly shot two other vehicles full of holes that contained innocent people.

c8ciu67	326	95	I'm pretty sure that's how you break your thumb.
c8cjzw3	226	26	This may surprise you then: http://youtu.be/JnU_QKoGzJM
c8ckdrk	31	9	Does that just apply to glocks, or all pistols?
c8ckgt6	43	4	Any striker-fired pistol. 
c8cjlpc	114	21	Not enough recoil, unless it was 50ae or something. The gun would just fail to feed. Your thumb would move, but it's flexible enough to deal with the slide travel. 
c8cjs9y	45	8	I have never actually seen a break, but I worked at a range for a while and I have seen about 6 people butterfly their thumb open by doing this.  It generally requires stitches.  The thumb may be flexible enough not to break, but don't underestimate the destructive power of that slide.  
c8cjv88	20	5	Called slide bite... but this isn't going to happen with your thumb directly behind it. Slide bite happens when the slide comes fully out over your hand, and pinches the skin between it and the frame on the way in, caused by gripping the pistol incorrectly. 
c8cjy2a	13	2	No, I'm not talking about slide bite (which happens far more often).  I'm talking about people keeping their thumb up, and the corner of the slide slices the skin on their thumb.  It cuts right down the middle of the thumb (through the joint and finger print).  Slide bite usually gets the side of the thumb or the fleshy part of your hand between your thumb and index finger.
c8cjrh2	61	13	There are sharp bits on the end of the slide that would probably cut open your thumb. 
c8cju06	108	10	We call that a "slide kiss".  Or "slide bite" if you and your sidearm are into the rough stuff.
c8ck6ih	39	6	So it has come to this.
c8ckojo	46	5	http://xkcd.com/1022/
c8ckgxz	10	2	I've always heard it called Berreta bite. Because the berretas tend to have hard angles on the slide that will slice the shit outta you.
c8cjzkr	11	2	Yep.  It would sting and all, but not much more than that.  I saw a guy on Youtube experimentally confirm this with a bunch of different parts of his hand intercepting the slide during its firing cycle.  I've searched and cannot seem to locate that same video, though I have found two where they stop the slide by grabbing it with the whole hand:  [Video 1.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdcSH3u2eUI)  [Video 2.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVtXPIjM3jQ)  Anyone have a link to the guy that keeps firing his pistol over and over jamming the slide with his off hand in a different way each time?  I remember him using his thumb at least once.

c8ckubb	30	2	pff.   do you even gun?
c8ckf4a	30	3	Please, do not gun.
c8cjuxm	544	72	With all the talk of the LAPD, let's not forget about NYPD's lovely job of handling ONE GUY who was standing 5 feet away from them.  IIRC 9 bystanders were shot . . . all shot by the police . . . before the guy they were aiming at got hit.
c8ckn0u	145	18	Better than [Amadou Diallo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadu_diallo)  Fired 41 times, hit him 19... for pulling out a wallet.  Yeah, the cops were let go.
c8ckrhd	158	18	The most bizarre aspect of that case was that based on the magazine capacity of the weapons fired by the officers, compared to the number of shots fired, at least one officer must have stopped firing, *reloaded*, and continued to fire at Diallo's body.
c8cksar	67	8	I'm glad someone actually remembered that. It wasn't a 10-second shooting... it went on for at least 30 seconds.
c8ckuh0	22	0	That's some Camus-ass shit right there.
c8cm70u	7	0	Reminds me of the ex-marine who got shot 88 times by a SWAT team who assaulted his house in the middle of the night, completely unidentified as police, when he had the nerve to go for a gun in his draw.   Even with automatic weapons, for three guys shooting at once that's five seconds at least. 
c8cmqof	17	2	It's situations like this that America should ban houses and night time!
c8cl0xd	12	0	Sounds like that one episode of the boondocks. 
c8clajb	6	0	With Uncle Ruckus pulling out his safety orange wallet - yup. It's inspired by events like this and is making fun of the situation in which this could happen and no cops really got in any trouble. 
c8cjx0p	338	41	At least they *saw* their target before shooting :/
c8ckebw	165	17	You would think that would help, turns out it doesn't. 
c8ckg2d	168	12	LOAD, FIRE, AIM
c8ckvq9	113	8	LOAD FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE RELOAD FIRE FIRE FIRE AIM
c8cm091	35	4	More like: "load fire fire fire fire aim paid vacation!"
c8cmjg3	7	0	then PROMOTIONS!
c8ckcee	79	17	FWIW, part of the problem is the NYPD uses Glocks with the trigger pull weight modified up to 12lbs instead of the stock 5lbs, which makes it harder to pull the trigger (yay safe) and thus harder to keep accurate while pulling the trigger (oh, not safe).
c8ckfby	59	17	Right, but even still . . . there's no excuse for being that bad.
c8cl3qi	19	3	The NYPD also trains maybe twice a year with their sidearms, and only on stationary targets at close range.
c8cl8j8	37	7	. . . stationary targets at close range should have been sufficient in this case.
c8ckmz1	13	1	whaaa? 12 lb trigger.  Thats nuts.
c8cjzr1	18	2	Talking about the guy with the knife? The guy that looked like Whoopi Goldberg on steroids?
c8ck3pa	72	11	No, I'm talking about this incident:  http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57499732/multiple-people-shot-near-empire-state-building/  16 shots fired by police.  9 pedestrians shot.  This is probably why the NY 7 bullet limit doesn't apply to cops.  They need 16 bullets just to take down one guy who is standing right next to them.
c8ckaze	57	9	&gt;The two officers fired 16 shots. The surveillance video shows Johnson pointing his weapon at police, but it's likely he did not get a chance to fire, investigators said.  &gt;Some of those injured may have been accidentally shot by the officers, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.  Pisses me off that news keep downplaying the facts that officer keeps shooting bystanders. The guy being shot at didn't even get to shoot and only thing they said about the bystanders getting shot is a quote saying they MAY have been shot by the police
c8ckcdu	32	7	It was downplayed, but it also wasn't initially clear what happened.  Later reporting typically mentioned that all 10 people shot were shot by police:  http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/25/justice/new-york-empire-state-shooting
c8chihw	221	38	come on, give these guys some credit. they have a better shot than the lapd.
c8chy3t	85	5	Yeah ... that truck did not show expert marksmanship 
c8cjgfo	46	6	There was actually a decent grouping on the passenger's side.
c8cjqf7	67	8	Many bullets also hit the houses behind the truck. There were people inside those houses that ducked at the sound of gunfire. That's just scary when you think about it.
c8cjwwn	30	5	One of the story's showed 6 bullet holes in one house and 5 in another, as well as a car parked on the street with shattered windows and two more holes and flat tires.
c8cklls	22	3	Wtf?! Why didn't they just drop a fuckin h-bomb on the truck? 
c8cldn9	21	3	They probably didn't have one on them.  That is honestly the reason it didn't happen, they did not have one.
c8ck84f	37	7	They were nothing but dumb luck away from "Multiple cops open fire on 2 unarmed women delivering newspapers; 7 year old girl killed by fire as bullets penetrated her bedroom.
c8cm1hw	6	0	they'd just add the charges onto the guy they're chasing
c8cjt94	47	11	It is definitely scary, and those guys sucked not only are firing but also recognizing a threat and responding to it. I don't think they wanted to hurt anyone besides the man they were looking for, but they need to face some sort of punishment or retraining.
c8ck0ib	64	6	No retraining. They should lose their privilege.
c8ckesb	34	6	Guys I think they need a paid vacation with no penalties.
c8ckfi2	19	1	A long and arduous vacation in the Bahamas with free accommodation! That will show them!
c8ckhgk	17	2	Definitely stormtrooper aim. 
c8ck6dv	4	0	They shot that group with a 12 gauge with buckshot unfortunately.  
c8ckxyo	4	0	Which is a bit worrying because they'd have absolutely no idea whether the passenger is friend or foe.
c8cjpg2	5	0	Or even ordinary vision.
c8ci8fj	10	1	Were the passengers killed?
c8cie0w	22	2	no
c8cjr2e	20	4	Oh man I thought they were. Well that's good news.
c8ck0vm	34	3	Also they shot up another guys truck and rammed it. They missed him like 12 times so he is OK.
c8ck3tt	23	4	I think it was only 3 shots into the windshield. As in they were looking at the guys face when they unloaded on him....................... BTW, did we ever get a description of him?
c8ckhyw	20	2	A skinny white guy. I cant find the link any more but I saw it on /r/dornercase Edit: http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-torrance-shooting-20130210,0,3955268.story
c8clatw	10	0	Apparently it's a damn good time to be a huge black man in LA, since the police are focusing efforts on skinny white guys and Asian women. 
c8cjvjt	75	4	One is in the ICU with a bullet or multiple bullets in her back.  The other had lacerations from flying glass.  I'm all kinds of pissed because if this had been a civilian doing the shooting even in a legit self-defense scenario they would have arrested them and charged them with reckless endangerment, malicious wounding, and a host of other crimes, but the cops aren't even being investigated by their local district attorney!    
c8cjzmv	35	5	The cops are on paid vacation and the LAPD is trying to buy off the women with a new truck. 
c8ckgiz	35	4	&gt;... the LAPD is trying to buy off the women with a new truck.   Is it armored? Because that would be a requirement for me in this situation.  
c8cki0i	12	1	Maybe an alarm that goes off if the cops ever get too close as well. 
c8cj711	16	0	Yeah I was gonna say, these guys are downright pros compared to the LAPD.
c8cjep7	19	0	Who's better storm troopers or the Lapd
c8cjpp2	35	7	Storm troopers. The LAPD shot to kill and only hit one in the hand, and one along the ribs. Have you seen the rebels storming Princess Leia's ship? Fucking marksmen are OP.

c8ck2aq	8	0	Actually, just write a warning notice on the very *tip* of your bullet, then you've technically warned the suspect before shooting them.
c8cjucd	25	5	Something like " Die Heretics" or " Cry sum moar"

c8cjs99	102	19	http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/torrance-shooting-dorner-manhunt.html Two women delivering newspapers got shot without warning while in their truck.  "Residents in the quiet Torrance cul-de-sac where Los Angeles police mistakenly fired on two women delivering newspapers reported hearing a barrage of gunfire and discovered bullets that pierced cars, trees, roofs and garage doors."  "She estimated hearing about 60 shots." 
c8cjtw5	39	7	Holy Flercking Shnit, were the two women okay in the end?
c8cjxii	57	12	One is in intensive care. The other is fine. The one in intensive is expected to be all right, too. It's surprising, when you look at what they did to that truck.
c8cjy7m	9	3	Are there pictures of the truck... what guns were they using :S
c8ck3ne	32	6	[This](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/ex-cop-manhunt-newspaper-delivery-women-shot.html) is the one people are talking about. But they also shot at a [Black Honda pickup](http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site577/2013/0207/20130207_094910_aatruck4_GALLERY.JPG) too.
c8ck5if	27	5	All the cars they shot are completely different, what were they thinking
c8ck5ul	23	6	They thought the women delivering newspapers was Dorner, presumably throwing a newspaper bomb at the house of the people they were watching.
c8ck3z3	9	1	To be clear, that wasn't the only truck the police around here fired upon that day. There was another incident in torrance, i believe.   as far as caliber, it's hard to say. Likely they started with their handguns. probably police .38 or 9mm, but some of the bullet holes look rather large caliber. which makes me think that someone grabbed something larger from the trunk or something.  picture of the two trucks that were shot are here: http://www.dailynews.com/ci_22548130  edit: i meant grabbed something larger from the trunk (of the police car), not truck.
c8ck10u	8	1	[Yes. Nissan Titan (pictured).](http://www.trbimg.com/img-5113e327/turbine/lat-bcpix-la0008167168-20130207/500/500x290)
c8cjzv3	19	2	Also, the truck they were in was wrong color AND wrong make/model. 
c8ck1s3	11	0	It must have been because 2 women totally look like a 270lb black male.
c8ck29i	11	0	You should be worrying about all of the other pickup drivers. They shot up another non-grey, non-nissan pickup truck on the same day.
c8cjvq7	26	6	I believe one got hit once, the other twice. Both injuries were non-life threatening.  &gt;"One has a minor gunshot wound and is in the process of being released. The second person is in stable condition, with two gunshot wounds," said Chief Beck. "Tragically, we believe this was a case of mistaken identity by the officers."  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/07/lapd-shooting-at-innocent-people_n_2638701.html
c8ck1sp	39	5	Non life threatening is not exactly the best description of getting shot in the back when you are 71. The bullet barely missed her spinal cord.
c8cjxow	6	1	Good to hear :S Insane situation to be in
c8ck2dq	10	1	Actually one is in the ICU.
c8cjzgo	8	0	60 shots, only a few hit. Thus the joke about how shitty shots they are. And I must say, holy shit they fucking suck at shooting.
c8cjrex	54	18	A guy who was previously in the LAPD (fired 3 years ago I believe) is now killing other LAPD officers. In an attempt to catch him, they're shooting several innocent people, including two elderly Asian women who were delivering newspapers, just because they were in a truck similar to his and "looked suspicious." You can find the picture in /r/California I believe, but essentially the truck had about 12 or more shots through it, several in the tailgate.
c8ck11m	42	7	Dismissed from the force 5 years ago, 2008, after he accused another officer of police brutality during an arrest. LAPD put on record that witnesses in the area didn't see anything. Right now no one is really sure if he's telling the truth about LAPD making things up or if he started losing it before he was fired.  Couple of days ago he shot and killed 1 officer and the daughter and the daughter's fiance of another officer. So no matter what, you know this guy has lost it. Even if he considers in his mind every LAPD officer as a collaborator, I don't know how he can excuse going after their families.   But, LAPD of course has to have the final word in a stupidity shout. So when all the warrants were put out and the sky filled with the sounds of choppers (more than usual for LA), the police went a little trigger happy. In the process the confused 1 Model of a pick-up truck with a specific Make, Model, Year and Color with another pick-up truck with completely different Make, Model, Year and Color. I'm not sure why they got confused. From reports they didn't ask the car to pull over, they just opened fire upon identification.   Now this goes back to the first question of why he was fired and maybe raises more question, or maybe it just highlights the incompetence of the LAPD under pressure.   At the end, everyone comes out looking bad and the citizens of LA feel terrorized. I don't know who won.
c8cllka	5	0	The more I read about the guys background the more it sounds like he's a stand up guy with some integrity. I got the impression that in this case the bad guys won, corrupt cops looked out for corrupt cops, and the guy left with nothing to lose and drawing further attention to a corrupt system to gain has gone to work.  I do not feel that Officer Dorner is entirely in the wrong.   There are times in life when there are no pretty solutions. From the sounds of things he spent 8 years trying every other option to shine a light on an injustice. This may be what it takes to bring real attention on something that should not be allowed to stand. 
c8ck9n7	11	2	It sounds like the stop and go of the 2 women in Torrance were similar to what happened when the Riverside officer was killed earlier. Still doesn't excuse the cops opening fire on an incorrect vehicle without waiting for a response, even in the twilight hours. From his manifesto and his actions, Dorner sounds like has numerous head issues and a persecution complex, but given the charge to lawfully and systematically apprehend the guy, the LAPD tragically bungles things up.   No winners here.

c8ckf4g	54	8	On the one hand, I am safe....my truck actually IS gray.  LAPD shoots  anything but the correct color.

c8cm0x5	7	1	Police really seem to flip out when it is the police being attacked. I really don't think they would be going through such an extensive man hunt operation (and be so ready to shoot and kill) if the three victims had been some random people in Compton. ...also they hate people who criticize police department operations and behavior.

c8crqm4	1	0	He posted Shatner (apparently, I'm mobile and honestly don't think anything he posts will enlighten my world view anyway). Also, black people tend to be really cool about nigga so long as you don't put the E R in it.
c8cshcx	1	0	&gt; Here's what socially conscious adults think:  Respect to him and all that, he's a phenominal actor, but honestly, he's *an actor*. Why is his *opinion* on the matter any more valid than Snowblind's? Because he was on a T.V. show a few decades back? How do you know Snowblind isn't a reputable sociologist? o_O  People who have these opinions usually fixate on others race more than those who don't. "Woah, this guy is black, gotta not say x y and z." You're still putting a persons race in front of the actual person.   It's like when I got into an accident, my friends called me a *terrible* driver. Our Korean friend gets into one the next week...awkward silence. Cause dude, *racial stereotypes.*

c8cmmdk	3	0	Wow...first YouTube person I've ever subscribed to! Amazingly hot.
c8clj9n	57	39	Am i the only one who thinks sweat pants and uggz are sexy?
c8cmef8	9	2	It's a great combination on her.  Looks ridiculously comfortable too.
c8clqtn	33	13	Sadly, no :(  I'm thinking (hoping?) its more the fact that she's hot as hell though. Where I live the more frequent wearer of such a style would be about 4 times her size and yet wearing the same sized pants, so I guess I'm a bit biased!
c8cmqov	15	4	I can't agree more. This is why the whole 'are sweatpants/uggs sexy or not' debate came about - they're sexy on a gorgeous girl in a sports bra, not so much on people of walmart.
c8cmxl4	12	2	~~He's~~ She's got it figured out, guys. The same clothing looks good on attractive people but not on unattractive ones! *Genius!*
c8cmykw	5	1	*she. My point was that there's no point in arguing if clothes are sexy on not, because it ultimately relies on the wearer. Yes, it should be an obvious point, but there's still endless comments on any post with a girl in sweatpants and uggs debating whether they're attractive. 
c8cn4pm	3	0	I agree, too. To be honest I didn't even realise it was Uggs until I read the comments. I was just giggling at a cat being dragged away. 
c8cu6eh	1	0	Me too. That's one relaxed kitty.
c8cmxt3	5	4	Uggs ,if they're hot, make the girl cuter IMO sweatpants I don't have some fetish for them but she looks damn good in them   edit:wording/punctuation
c8cp0sx	6	1	Could you please add some punctuation to that sentence?
c8cnoxy	3	0	Yeah that kind of ruins it. A hot chick can make pretty much anything look hot.
c8cmoph	2	0	right there with ya :)

c8cqbi5	1	0	i'mmmmmmmmmmm pretty sure OP's a faggot

c8cl5bj	8	15	why strip in uggz? Edit: ok why ""pole dance"" in uggz?
c8cmbv4	13	1	She's not a stripper, she's a pro as fuck pole dancer and teacher. She has that installed at home, I'm assuming to practice and make new dances.
c8ctwzf	1	0	Might be a fire station.

c8ck7x1	984	179	I'm not even a little bit surprised because Reddit has like tens of millions of users.  We could probably make our own shitty little country if we wanted to.
c8cma7q	104	23	/r/redditisland. It's pretty much dead but
c8cmq7u	91	13	I miss this and wish we could make it happen, if only for fun.     We probably could if we really tried.. [I mean there's a post about a 45 hectacre island for sale for 540k](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditisland/comments/13moxk/island_in_patagonia_for_sale_in_hornopir%C3%A9n_palena/) and we raised over 500k for a bus monitor that some kids harassed.   
c8cmydu	70	3	The island doesn't have an internet connection.
c8cmzfb	151	27	Yet
c8co985	10	1	We have the technology!
c8cnjfp	8	1	Probably because many, many redditors are reluctant to even go to a meetup, let alone paying to buy a land to let redditors like us run it.  Plus the project is waaay too unorganized from the beginning. Most of the people participating in the project are only "idea" guys, giving torrents of fun, seemingly plausible ideas and suggestion while doing pretty much just as much as you and I.
c8cmx0p	24	7	Do we make it a resort for redditors only? Admission is 100000 link/comment karma combined. But still have a background check so people like [WarPhalange](http://www.reddit.com/user/WarPhalange) don't get in?
c8cn2w9	41	6	100,000 combined karma is a bit excessive 
c8cn4rn	36	3	I'd tend to agree, but it seems if we ever made front page the island would be populated with us and the ladies of r/gonewild.  Edit: If you're a man posting to r/gw you'll never make it to the island.
c8cnwt7	3	0	You make that sound like a bad thing.
c8cnbio	11	0	make it 10,000?
c8cn47t	23	11	We're going to need an /r/trees section on the island... and you know none of us have the time to get 100,000 karma.
c8cnvtu	4	1	I suspect that the plant would be 100% legal and unregulated with the exclusion of exportation. That would be a fun place...
c8cnxez	15	8	&gt;and you know none of us have the time to get 100,000 karma.  Because smoking weed is hard work.
c8cn1cp	28	21	There's too many diverse users for a redditisland to be fun or interesting. You would just be surrounded by a lot of dumb and annoying people, and they would probably perceive you the same way. There is no real common trait we share to make us feel like we're in good company.(being lonely isn't good enough)
c8cn2h8	33	7	&gt;There's too many diverse users for a redditisland to be fun or interesting.     wat  I've heard people say a lot of things about diversity but I've never heard anyone say diversity is *boring*
c8cn4rl	21	3	"OMG BETTY, THEY ARE LIKE, ALL DIFFERENT TO ME, THIS IS SOOOOO DULL"
c8cmuf3	20	2	I was kind of hoping that Reddit Island would become a reality... just so I could eventually read about its inevitable collapse once their supply of frozen pizza rolls ran out.
c8cmva2	3	0	Just checked it out.  Why would they want to  all go live somewhere together?  Maybe I'm missing something, but this whole thing seems a little out of touch.
c8clxka	346	76	Shitty?  We'd be the porn and puppy capital of the world.
c8cmbkr	73	12	it would be a cock fest.
c8cmjgo	50	8	As long as we had the state of "Gone Wild" no man would be lonely in the country of Reddit.
c8cmkiw	25	5	You know there are a lot of men posting there aswell? They just don't make it to the front page
c8cmkwp	11	3	Would that be the red light district?

c8clqcr	124	24	I wonder if she ever goes to bars without getting asked to take a picture
c8cmat9	111	24	Or having to buy her own drinks
c8cmqgo	41	10	Which might be the reason she's there in the first place. Gets recognized, takes a photo or two, drinks free. 
c8cnjuv	8	1	Nah, she's a regular from what I hear
c8cpxy5	6	0	And drinks free.
c8cnsyj	9	6	You just described every girl ever.
c8cnk4o	16	2	I saw her on Halloween at a bar but didn't want to be "that guy" that interrupted her time with friends.

c8cn7ez	19	3	Frankly with all the attention I don't understand how she's unattached.

c8cmvno	106	15	nah dude...she just pulled that face so often, that it got stuck that way  her mom warned her...but she didn't listen...she didn't listen
c8coeco	9	1	I can't believe I actually went cross-eyed
c8cn2lo	13	2	&gt;never seems to tire of pulling the same face  Where's that picture of her from College Orientation or something where you can just see the exhaustion in her eyes?

c8cljxt	42	12	I wish I had the real life overly attached gf too!
c8clu9z	50	13	I've had one.  You do not want one.    Attachment is fine, but there's a line.  
c8cmgzt	14	6	Attachment becomes controlling becomes obsession becomes crazy.  Edit: *over* attachment
c8cmktv	16	8	And you should NEVER stick your dick in crazy!

c8cqjto	5	1	That's the "Vicky Mendoza Diagonal".
c8cm1ev	15	5	I concur, but are there any good pictures of her not doing her OAG face?
c8cmt9h	23	3	[Here is one](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LPC05tZ2rs8/T-IsrC6sYkI/AAAAAAAAA5I/pau2L2svAlM/s1600/laina.jpg), posted on [her website](http://www.lainawalker.org/p/about.html).
c8cn3i9	14	2	All of the comments on her blog are creepy as fuck. Random old dudes drooling over her and asking to have her babies. 
c8cniok	46	2	So it's like reddit?
c8cnkcb	3	0	Yeah pretty much. 
c8cm9al	9	5	Plenty were posted during her "peak". Apparently when she is asked to pose she ask if you want the normal face or OAG face, but almost everyone ask for the OAG face.
c8cn6bj	4	2	If only she wouldn't pull that insane look on every picture.
c8cmgxc	7	0	Kind of feel sorry for her, that must get annoying
c8cmjny	10	3	I wonder if she's tired of making that face. 
c8cmkky	7	0	Okay, the guy on the far right is fucking scary.

c8cmokg	13	1	so...i gotta ask..I see a lot of guys getting their pictures taken with this chick...is anyone scoring with her?
c8cla3r	60	17	Poor girl can't even get a drink in peace
c8cmei5	101	12	Who goes to a bar to drink in peace?
c8cmf8m	102	17	Someone who makes poor financial decisions. 
c8cmzio	4	2	Someone catching up with a friend or two over drinks. There goes the watering hole.

c8cmh9f	5	0	I wonder if she is ready to not be noticed
c8cmnya	6	0	Is that her normal face?
c8cl5g7	26	9	Looks like someone has a bad case of hoverhand
c8cmwq6	13	0	I think it looks more like the lesser know beta fist, where the guy makes a fist so as to not have to directly lay his hand on the girl.
c8cmcp8	7	5	I'm speculating this was purely out of precaution.  You don't want to give her a reason to start calling.  EDIT:  I'm now not sure whose hand was the subject
c8cms3q	4	0	X-RAY, X-RAY
c8cmyx4	5	1	If I ever met Laina in real life, I would ask her for a picture but tell her to give me a normal face. She's probably sick of all the requests for the OAG look at this point.
c8crng4	3	1	That crazy chick is pretty fuckin' damn sexy...
c8cmjys	7	1	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZrzg62Zj0
c8cm5pz	7	1	False, she just wears that top every night
c8cmtnl	12	5	My god I'm so tired of that woman. No offense though. 
c8cmdsf	17	10	She's so hot to be honest.
c8cltqs	13	6	My favourite part is she can do the face on command.
c8cmleu	19	1	Doesn't everyone have a face they can do on command?
c8cmxn6	2	1	So, what is the story with this girl? I'm sure I'm lame for not knowing, but does she just nomadically travel the states, looking for unsuspecting redditors?
c8cn2tn	3	0	Am I the only one who just finds that face irritating?
c8covcb	3	0	LET THIS MEME DIE

c8cmasu	7	2	that jawline on the right :|
c8cl1qx	10	7	Can OAG even be found outside a bar?
c8cmxgy	4	1	I bet that poor girl's eyes hurt after a night out in the public and having to make that same face a gagillion times. Also, its probably hilarious to watch people who obviously doesn't know who she is seeing her making that same expression in pictures.
c8cn4kb	3	3	Damn it she's cute
c8cm2u4	13	10	She's quite lucky because her videos aren't actually funny, its the people who took her picture and made the memes that made her famous.
c8cmaie	2	0	Is she Dallas based?

c8cmtsn	1	0	Hover hand!
c8cmwet	1	1	Maybe she has 10 shirts that all look the same.  Or maybe they were just at the same bar.....that's also a possibility. I'm going to assume the first is true.
c8cmwk5	1	1	the only vaguely surprising part is how cool she continues to be about this stuff
c8cmx89	2	0	xray it?
c8cmz1y	1	0	Either that or she's pulling a Radcliff

c8cn3ow	1	1	Everywhere I go there's a redditor...
c8cn4gu	1	1	Unless they know each other it's not very surprising they didn't know they were in the same bar...
c8cn5jt	1	1	Is she an alcoholic? Every picture I see of her is in a bar. If she's not already she will be from all the free drinks she gets.
c8cn5wa	1	1	Why would they know it? It's not like we wear badges or something.
c8cn6h9	1	1	Dat chin
c8cn6n0	1	1	Man, she gets around. Is she doing paid drop ins at bars or something or is she just a heavy drinker?
c8cn7dy	1	1	I wonder if people even have to ask her for a picture any more, or whether she just defaults to, "Do you want to get a picture with me?" when they recognise her.
c8cn8o9	1	1	Holy Good Lord! You found her... 
c8cnbfw	1	1	It was probably a gathering of the all the attractive redditors... All three of them. 
c8cnbk4	2	0	It is nice of her to take that many pictures with people happily.

c8cu2dd	2	0	we can all go home now folks
c8cpqqq	10	3	Drilling a hole in the top would cause the water to spill out due to the change in air pressure
c8cq9fk	4	1	Do NOT do this.
c8con0p	17	12	If you drill a hole water will just pour out of the glass.
c8clvfu	315	50	the seal is formed because a very small amount of the water does actually leak out around the bottom, forming an airtight seal and preventing air getting into the glass to let the water drain.  put a paper towel down up against the edge of the glass, and it'll draw that water into it.  As it absorbs water, the water it's absorbed will be 'replaced' by the water in the glass, slowly but surely draining the entire thing into the towel(s).  Alternately, make a 'trail' of paper towel off the edge of the bench and leading into a bucket underneath.  The water will drain to the lowest point (the end of the paper towel) and then drip off and into the waiting bucket.  Capillary action.. aka SCIENCE, BITCHES!
c8cm3pg	246	35	All you have to do is slide them to the edge of the counter into a basin of some sort. Laziness bitches!
c8cn1vd	40	4	I was thinking just not moving them, parents are likely to care more about glasses left out than their kids are.
c8cnfu8	82	13	It's fucking water on the kitchen table. It's water. Water. You just lift the glasses and live with the consequences, forever.
c8cp0qc	31	2	&gt;It's fucking water on the kitchen table. It's water. Water.  Don't fuck with water. A few weeks ago my toilet flooded. Not the knee-high flood that you see in movies, but maybe 2-bucketfulls ended up on my floor. You think that's it? Fuck no. This water quickly ended up in the storage room, ruining nearly all of the boxes on the floor and in 2 bedrooms, stinking up carpets. Then, it got under several pieces of furniture and is still stinking to this day after being cleaned constantly. Water is a bitch with a 16" strap-on. Do not fuck with it.
c8cu05p	1	1	also, water is much more outside a glass than it looks on the inside.  everybody who spilled water over his keyboard knows that. 3cm in a glass is like a horrible tsunami on the desk.

c8cp3a3	8	0	You are way over-thinking this. just slide the glass onto the note left by the daughter (which may even be the original piece used to flip the glass) and then flip it over.  If you want to absorb the mess just get a bath towel and lift the glass. Who has time to wait for 100 paper towels to absorb water? amirite?  
c8cnctj	7	1	Sounds like a great tactic, but air will need a way to get in too for this to work.
c8cndnm	3	0	When I saw this I thought it was explaining how they got the water/glasses like that in the first place and was very confused.
c8cobwr	4	1	If you slide a sheet of paper under the glass, you can lift it and atmospheric pressure will keep the water inside.
c8cpd9l	2	0	A vacuum would form at the top and stop water draining out though.
c8cpgn4	2	0	Just wrap it with a dry towel...
c8cpxb3	1	0	I like it. Alternately, you could probably slide a thin bit of plastic between the glass and the counter, then quickly flip the glass upright, the reverse of how I suspect they did it in the first place?

c8cmwfa	30	7	Le Gem level: quartz. 
c8cktfi	6	1	Get a bunch of chewing gum. Chew it up a bit and stick it around the glass where it meets the counter. I suggest multiple layers to be safe. After you have created a seal,  stick one end of a long straw in the gum with the other end leading to another larger cup or to the sink. Slightly tilt the cup at an angle so the straw can be pressed under the glass without allowing water to seep out.   The water should drain into the larger cup/sink without much of a mess,  and any additional water not redirected should remain in the center of the circular seal you've created and be easy to clean up with a towel. 
c8clb5y	7	1	Ooh! Another twist on this idea, especially if you can't get it to drain properly or a sink is too far away:    Open a bottle of water and take a few sips,  then cut a hole in the bottle top large enough to allow a decent length,  small diameter flexible hose/tube to pass through.   Stick the tube through the cap leaving only a few centimeters of hose protruding on the bottom side  and seal with gum on either side of the bottle cap.  Then take the other end of the hose through the gum seal created around the glass and position it so the end is sticking above the water line inside the glass.   Prepare the drain tube as discussed in the previous post.   Now drop two or more alka-seltzer into the bottle of water and quickly replace the cap with the tube sticking out of it. The pressure created by the dissolving alka-seltzer will flow from the water bottle to the inside of the glass,  building up until it forces the water out of the drain tube.   If your system is properly sealed, you can probably build enough pressure to shoot the water at least a foot or more into your desired target. Either that or you'll make a huge mess. But at least this mess will be fun to make.

c8cm4hw	16	4	Break the glass and let the water spill everywhere then leave a note saying "clean this up [or I'm feeding it to you](https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/1101514544/insanity_wolf_2009-05-01_15-06-40_1_.jpg)"  Edit: Brake/break. Was distracted

c8cp9br	11	5	OPs a FAGGGGGOOOTTTT
c8cnnzm	4	1	How do you do that?
c8cnojd	6	3	That wouldn't work in Australia.
c8cklil	24	8	Daddy writes like a woman. 
c8ckxie	35	3	If you read it carefully, you can just barely make out the fact that it's a girl writing to her dad. "Love you daddy" not "love you, daddy". 
c8cnf7n	9	2	Learn what the word troll means, please. 
c8cn1oy	9	4	I don't know why people think this was the dad doing this. "Love you Daddy" means it's his child doing this. If it was the dad, he would write:  Love you  Daddy  Also, this is a repost from a few days ago, stop doing that.
c8ckfgt	8	2	How is that even possible?
c8ckhoq	20	1	Put a card on top of the full glass (make sure it covers the entire mouth) and then quickly flip the glass.  Place the upside down card and glass on the table and then remove the card without moving the glass.
c8cnf40	23	1	Tried doing that. You're a liar. There's water EVERYWHERE. 
c8ckj8p	5	0	It's so simple! I'm a dumbass for not realizing that..
c8cmkh5	18	2	Another possibility is using ice although it would obviously take a while for the ice to melt.
c8ckp6s	10	5	Could whoever this was for not then do the reverse to get out of this liquidy situation? (Put the card under and quickly flip right-side-up)
c8cn0m3	3	0	Unfortunately no, this instance you lift the glass or force a card underneath it, the seal will break leaking water everywhere.
c8cng2a	11	2	Then fall for the trap. But next morning, leave his car keys in an upside/down glass of water, then leave a note: ''have a nice day at work dad''
c8cp3n7	3	0	they just need this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDlHGhKHIdM
c8cl6dp	11	2	Another way beside the card is to freeze a half full cup of water and once frozen put upside down on counter. This takes a little more time so has a much higher chance of being noticed before its ready but if you have all day to set up its not a problem.
c8cn0jp	6	0	I see a problem with this, in that the trapped air will be cold; as it warms and expands, it would force the water out. Better would be using warm water w/ the card method, so that it vaccuum attaches to the counter, making it very difficult to remove :P
c8co2f8	3	0	Just fill it with ice cubes and flip upside down onto counter. Tada!
c8cmeq4	3	0	The solution is simple, drill a hole through the top of those glasses, then it's a simple matter of rigging up a long tube and getting the initial flow going.  NB: Do not drink the water, there will be bits of glass in it.
c8cmxut	4	0	It was actually a facebook post from a girl to her father :P if it was father to daughter it would have been "love you, daddy"
c8cmzdt	4	1	Should have been titled, "Dad who writes like teenage girl".
c8cn2d6	3	0	I used to bus tables at a Big Boy restaurant as my high school job.  I had to work "bar rush" on Friday and Saturday nights, and we got drunks that would come in and thought this was funny to do, and put a penny in the glass with the water. I just started quickly pulling the glass toward the end of the table, dumping everything in a plastic bin we put the dirty dishes in, and wiping up the little water that spilled. 
c8cn9hr	3	0	In my house, no one would touch these glasses ever again.
c8cnbr7	3	0	Put the notecards *underneath* the cups, the scoot the arrangement to the side and off the counter.
c8cmmjy	9	5	Fairly sure this was on the front page a few days ago
c8cn2sb	10	5	The horror!
c8cn3x1	5	1	my eye twitches now whenever someone misuses the word 'troll'
c8cngp9	3	3	Troll level: Dad
c8ckxe5	2	0	Plot twist: two jars impossible to open with water in them
c8cmski	1	0	Just push a piece of (relatively firm) paper under the glass, slide it to the edge of the counter, press the paper to the glass while you carefully turn it around.   This will be the reversed procedure of how the glasses were placed there like this.
c8cmxt1	3	1	That was something a girl left for her dad after he refused to buy her concert tickets. 
c8cmzgp	1	0	If you slide the cups off the counter over a bowl, it's an easy clean-up. 
c8cmzrr	1	0	Leave it. that's all you do don't bother with it he will eventually have to clean it up and this would be his fault.
c8cn1wd	2	0	Wow you're dad has skills. That looks like actual glass. If I tried that I'd probably break the damn things.
c8cn4np	2	0	Motha fuckas be on some bill nye shit. 
c8cn5dv	2	0	"Troll".
c8cn5tl	2	0	its water. on a kitchen counter. just pick up the glasses and come back 12 hours later. problem solved.
c8cn7cr	1	1	just don't touch it and they will have to clean it up themselves.. fail troll, easily adverted. 
c8cnalf	3	0	It should say, *Troll kid level:asshole*
c8cnduh	2	0	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ctaA2mERzI  Check mate *dad* 
c8cnfz7	2	0	Put a pint glass almost full of water against the ceiling. Get someone to hold it up with a sweeping brush handle. Leave. 
c8cnhjj	2	0	I'd take a bowl to the edge of the counter and move the glasses so that the water goes into the bowl.  
c8cnlww	2	0	If you ever get a shitty waitress/waiter put their tip under that. And I'm not talking "oh my food was 5 seconds late," I'm talking annoyed that you're breathing their air, just shitty waitstaff.
c8cnmsb	2	0	I assume that the glasses are at the dads own house. So just lift up the glasses and let him clean his own mess. Not so "troll" anymore, are you dad?
c8cnrvj	2	0	Drag glass of water close to the edge of the table, get a bowl or such, drag glass of water hlfway out of the table, over the bowl, repeat, dad counter-troll'd
c8co013	2	1	LE TROLOLOLOL LEVEL: LELELELELELELE SAGANPAUL

c8co5nn	1	1	Wait how did  they do that?
c8co7cp	1	1	Do [this]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ctaA2mERzI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)
c8co7jr	1	0	I've left a $1 tip like this at a restaurant where the waiter was being an asshole.
c8co8q6	1	0	Whoever did this truly is a troll. The way to do it is right in front of you! You take the index card and slide it under the glass, then flip it over.
c8coabr	1	0	ITT: a bunch of interesting ways to clean the water up.
c8cocub	2	0	Solution: Take the note card that was used to write the note, slip it under the glasses (sure some will spill, but the seal will re-form). Flip the cups, wipe up with 1 paper towel. Done.
c8cohmn	1	1	I'm impressed he got it like that to start
c8corvg	1	0	Your dad has pretty decent handwriting for a guy.
c8cowgb	1	0	work on your reading comp, little buddy. 
c8coxz2	1	0	How to defeat this troll:  1. Open all doors and windows. 2. Get your largest coat and winter gear on. 3. Enjoy a good show on TV while you wait for the water to freeze. 4. place now frozen water in sink. 5. enjoy your dad's reaction to the next heating bill.
c8cozpt	2	0	The only solution is to get some paper towel. Lay a circle around the glasses and get some cling wrap. Place the cling wrap over the two glasses in a horizontal line, but so it reaches the paper towel as well. Repeat with more cling wrap but vertically, then diagonally, until all the edges of the paper towel circle have been reached. Then you need to place several tampons on top of each glass but obviously the cling wrap is going to be in-between, but that doesn't matter at this stage. Get some old egg cartons. Place them randomly around the room. Basically just keep piling more and more garbage until whoever left the glasses there gets pissed off at you, then leave the house and go to a pub. 
c8cp0zv	1	0	get that chopping board next to the glasses on the right, put it level at the side of the counter, drag the glasses ontop of the chopping board (reducing loss of water) and then bring the chopping board to the sink and tip away sir, easy.
c8cp2gy	1	0	Your title physically pains me. I feel disgusted sharing a universe with people like you.
c8cp73d	1	0	am i the only one wondering how to re-create this conundrum for an unsuspecting victim?
c8cpbiy	3	0	The handwriting is too feminine. 
c8cpbt4	2	0	I like that the solution to the problem is on the note itself, or rather, is the note itself. All you have to do is slide that card underneath one glass at a time, and lift glass and card simultaneously, then flip over glass and-well-I'm sure you can figure it out from there.
c8cpe2g	1	0	how do you do this i want to know 
c8cpgon	1	0	Well... Not that bad. He could put oil instead of water.
c8cpi89	2	1	I uploaded this before him . But good job getting front page! 
c8cpjw9	3	0	This is a repost, it was from a girl to her father 
c8cpks2	1	0	Wow, I took a high school science class too!
c8cpo3w	1	1	Just use a bucket.
c8cpq23	3	0	I guess were not even gonna wait 12 days to repost stuff now are we?
c8cqcmh	1	0	So many solutions in this thread about how to move the glasses with minimal spillage when I would have just walked away.
c8cqhx7	1	0	solution. get a large mixing bowl and hold it next to the counter. then slide the cup across the counter to the bowl and the bowl will catch all the water
c8cql5c	2	0	Place large bowl at the end of the counter top lip, then quickly drag the glass off the counter top and over the bowl. Any remaining water can easily be cleaned up with paper towels.
c8cqr8k	1	0	I come to the comments to figure out how the fuck they did this and all you've been talking about is who's trolling who. I'm losing my faith in you reddit
c8cqw0c	1	0	my buddy does this all the time at Denny's with orange soda .. he doesnt put anything on top of it.. he just lifts it, flips it and slams it on to the table in a fast motion.. it works.. and then the same waitress brings him the dishes bucket to remove it from the table without getting it all over the place.. drunk science. 
c8cr3oh	1	0	Karma whore. That's not a good challenge.
c8cr863	1	0	Reminds me of the physicist, Richard Feynman. He did this to a waitress once, and put the tip in the glass of water. She was unamused.  From his autobiography, "Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman".  Excerpt: http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~eggplant/feynman/1.html
c8cr8yx	1	0	I'd just put some dirty towels all around it, grit my teeth and let em rip.  Easy clean up!
c8cr9jx	1	0	Imagine if they did it with red wine?
c8cre96	2	0	No man writes that nicely.... troll level, you.
c8crf8m	1	0	Get a bucket or a bowl, push the cups all the way to the edge then release the water into the bucket or bowl. 
c8crghw	1	0	Place towel around glass and lift it.
c8crgy6	1	0	Move them to the side f table and catch the water with a bucket
c8crk30	1	1	We used to do this with a napkin. The napkin soaks up a little water,and the the excess napkin can be tore from around the glass. We leave these on our table if we get extremely shitty service.  I also work in food,and for tips.....so I mean really shitty service.
c8cryd1	1	0	What I'm wondering is how did he manage to do that.
c8cstjc	1	0	Form a ring of flour about 5 inches high around the two glasses. As you slowly lift one glass out, mix it into the flour. By the time you're done you have much of a pizza already mixed onto your counter.
c8ctmat	1	0	Your father is Richard Feynman?
c8ctw6i	1	0	Get bucket, put bucket next to edge, slide glass to edge over bucket, less mess that way.
c8cucnr	1	0	But it's so easy to solve
c8cuflv	1	0	Slide parchment paper under the glass, wrap the access paper around the glass, hold, carry over to sink, dump water. 
c8cv5wv	2	0	Maybe I don't get it but why lift them up in the first place? Just leave them there for him....
c8cvbyh	1	0	why is this a challenge? Grab a coaster or a piece of thin cardboard, slide it under the glass, pick the glass and coaster up, together, flip, repeat. Job's a good'un.
c8cvctj	1	0	knock them over, and wait for it to evaporate.
c8cvi1n	1	0	How did they even do that?
c8cwdwy	1	0	I would be more concerned about how they got it under the cups...
c8cxrjs	1	0	The goddamn smiley face is goddamn sideways... You know, when you're writing something with a pen or marker, you can put actually put the smiley face THE GODDAMN CORRECT WAY.

c8cxd24	6	1	You're dumb. 
c8cxhd4	3	0	Higher functions. Your brain has none.
c8cycsf	3	0	Unlike many elevators that you've encountered, this increments vertically through columns instead of horizontally by rows. (See below) It's not jumping everywhere. The M stands for Mezzanine, and is between the ground floor and the first. 4A is probably another half-floor which is between the 4th and 5th floors.  This arrangement makes sense, it's just different.  This elevator goes:      ^ ^ ^     | | |     | | |     | | |     1 2 3  As opposed to:      3---&gt;     2---&gt;     1---&gt;
c8cwl2j	1	0	The M and the 4A is what's throwing me off here....
c8cxr8s	2	0	M=mezzanine. Essentially a half floor, between two floors. No idea about 4A though...

c8czvjw	2	1	160K karma from just reposting shit every couple days?
c8ckycd	15	0	There is a scientific explanation for this phenomenon. A small amount of suction is created by the air outside flowing past the window drawing air inside the building. We humans may not notice this because of how miniscule the draft may be, but it is quite significant to a fly. (Think about how it feels sticking your hand out a car window at 70 mph/110kph.)   So as the fly comes near a window,  the change in air pressure (high outside the window -&gt; low as it nears the window -&gt; none inside the building) draws him inside the building. But as he tries to leave, he is going from an article a of no pressure to an area of mid to low pressure,  making it difficult to overcome the wind resistance.   Either that or flies are just stupid. I don't know. I'm not an aerodynamics expert. 
c8ctr1i	1	0	Isn't it just because there really isn't anything in nature that is like glass, therefor flies aren't "prepared" for it. They just don't know about the concept "glass" so they think they can go through. Also, their brain is probably to small for them to be able to learn from their failed attempts. 
c8cvkkt	1	0	That makes a lot of sense, do you have a source for this information? 
c8cp71z	3	1	why so complicated? they just fly after the smell using their noses from the outside in, which obviously leads them through where there's a hole through which the smell goes out. And once they want to return they try to fly back out by orienting towards the sun using their eyes which leads them against glass instead.  also your theory fails as soon as there is any kind of wind or you open/close a door to the room. I find flies get stuck just as much when there is wind.

c8cwp87	1	0	There is any easy way to rid your house of any pesky flies. Kinda works like the window. First take a soda/Gatorade bottle and cut the top part off. Fill the bottom part with a little bit of sugar mixed with a little water. Invert the top portion and fit it on top of the bottom section. The flies will fly in and not be able to exit.

c8ch18p	8	3	This is one of my favorite scenes.
c8cfiza	2393	769	I wish I had your brother, I hate the chocolate, it ruins my vanilla.  Edit: Holy shit, Vanilla has earned me a month of Reddit Gold! Thank you!
c8ch3py	645	107	OP's brother, you, and myself would make great roommates, because I always go for the strawberry first.
c8chjip	429	73	I'd make for a great fourth. I own a Baskin Robbins store.
c8chkay	84	22	Where....
c8ci8t9	87	18	Somewhere magical no doubt.... I think every kids dream is to own an ice cream store and he did it... All I did with my life was become a diabetic

c8cht9d	29	5	50% discount for mentioning Reddit to the cashier.
c8ciara	26	4	If you ask the cashier when the narwhal bacons, however, you get a punch in the face and banned from the store.
c8chxo3	21	6	But then you'll need to leave an 18% tip.
c8cj4qn	17	1	I give God 10% why do they get 18?
c8chov1	4	1	AMA?
c8chfwt	302	57	Agreed. Everyone knows STRAWBERRY is where it's at. 
c8chlr5	108	13	Well, the funny thing here is that it's much easier to get along with someone you *disagree* with on which flavour is best, since that leads to less conflict.  
c8chn6z	120	22	Fuck your username.  Fuck it right in the ear.

c8chqdg	23	2	I'm on my phone and I just walked to a computer to get your joke... Probably could have saved myself the time and guessed.
c8ci1wg	11	1	joke's on you. I have a dvorak keyboard
c8ci5dr	9	1	With Soviet keyboard you are joke.
c8chu1m	16	3	I've never been so afraid of my keyboard.
c8ci49n	8	1	Thought it was going to be "U", got a hearty chuckle when I was wrong.
c8chqax	34	5	It reminds me about the most enjoyment I've ever got from people trolling.  CounterStrike 1.6  &gt;Hey guys, how do I change my spray/use mic/etc.  &gt;It's CTRL + W  &gt;Noob has disconnected.
c8ci5sc	6	0	haha yeah that was fun. I think the key was f10 though.
c8ci92e	4	0	Seriously? You'd troll them by having the walk forward while crouched?  I believe the key was F8.
c8chp9e	12	0	Which I, of course, didn't notice until you called attention to it.

c8ciawp	3	0	I'm on a mac so nothing happened. Then I tried Command + W, joke's on me.
c8chv9n	11	9	It deletes system 32, makes your computer run faster.  Shank doesn't want people to know about because then Microsoft might get rid of it, as they want people's computers to run slower so they need to buy new ones.

c8ci2zd	5	0	Excuse me, sir/Madame. We all know vanilla is the finest of the flavors. 
c8chl41	8	0	If this were to somehow actually happen, you have to make sure you tell people that it was the ice cream that brought you together. And when you guys split because kt00na all of a sudden decides vanilla is HIS flavor, well then the ice cream taketh away.

c8chw9f	15	11	Maaaaarge. We need more neapolitan ice cream!
c8cgfab	235	28	Hahah! Actually I just don't like chocolate *ice cream*, but I obsess over 70% cacao dark chocolate and stuff.
c8chtzb	440	34	Translation: I have a black friend.   Still racist.
c8chydv	282	31	I am not racist. I'll have you know, some of my best slaves are black.
c8cic5x	56	6	I just prefer white girls. 
c8cilbz	26	6	I like black girls. Especially when they have a bit of white inside.
c8cjin9	14	3	As do black men.
c8cic2z	17	1	So I met Wayne Brady in an elevator the other day. I've been trying to brag about it to everyone I know, but somehow no one knows who the fuck he is! Personally, I think they're all lying to me to make me angry/because they're jealous. I'm telling you this because I feel like finally someone who I can talk to since, well, you're Wayne Brady...son

c8cicul	7	1	I agree, I hate chocolate ice cream too. Chocolate ice cream from neapolitan ice cream doesn't taste like chocolate, it tastes bitter.
c8cjopv	7	0	I'm the same, I love chocolate, I love ice cream, but I cannot stand the taste of chocolate ice cream
c8cjbbo	6	0	I'm with ya buddy. I can't stand chocolate ice creams. However, vanilla with chocolate syrup is always fine for some reason...  
c8cgaec	38	27	just to add to the conversation, Tracy Jordan is an asshole
c8ch6qp	83	5	What about Tracy Morgan?
c8chmp6	22	5	Kinda homophobic, actually. 
c8cinss	13	1	Assuming this is over the bit he had about stabbing his fag son, can comedians really be judged when they are experimenting with new jokes in a comedy club? 
c8chazb	25	19	He's kind of annoying too.
c8chk36	18	1	Ditto, I love the vanilla and strawberry.
c8cg09b	22	2	Yeah. His brother isn't an asshole, he's quite considerate.
c8cgfnf	18	0	Indeed, I know a lot of people that would finish the bucket and pretend it never existed.
c8chbd6	16	1	I confess 
c8ch1z2	10	0	It goes well with the chocolate, the chocolate just sucks alone
c8chm4j	12	0	That is how I like it.  I don't like chocolate ice cream alone, but I like it swirled in with vanilla or strawberry.  If eating any ice cream alone, out of those three anyway, it would probably be vanilla, then strawberry, then chocolate.
c8chih6	9	0	but... Black and white in harmony...  [*Look to the cookie elaine, look to the cookie*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlLPAIrmqvE)
c8chki6	6	0	Agreed if my brother did this every day he'd be the best brother ever 
c8chr2j	3	0	He would also be quite rotund.
c8ciq38	6	0	Hate chocolate as well.  Would have loved his brother.  
c8ci2fy	5	0	Same. I am a fellow chocolate hater. I wish they would make one with just Vanilla and Strawberry side by side. "Vanilla and Strawberry Ice Cream" is usually just vanilla ice cream with strawberry syrup or chunks of strawberries in them.
c8ci517	3	0	Not that Strawberry shortcake bullshit, or Vanilla with strawberry swirl, NO. Strawberry and Vanilla side by side.
c8chqt1	4	0	Vanilla is the best ice cream ever
c8chraz	6	1	Vanilla power.
c8chwrc	3	0	We should buy ice cream together because I love strawberry
c8ci5b4	3	0	I like to combine the flavors to create such awesomeness as strawnilla, or chocoberrynilla, or perhaps vastrawchoc, which sounds like a weird kind of edible chalk. No matter I eat like a king!
c8ci77j	2	1	[Let me say that for you!](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1333628/foogoograsss/i_wish_i_had_your_brother.mp3)
c8cjgmt	3	0	When I was a kid my parents would get Neapolitan ice cream. Chocolate would run out first, then vanilla, and finally strawberry would last forever because we didn't like it.  That's why now I get this:  http://www.bluebell.com/icecreamflavors/TheGreatDivide.html  Whoever came up with this combination deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.  Just imagine how many arguments this has avoided.
c8chgvl	8	3	Oh wow. I thought those were eggs and ham. I was way off!
c8cfwnw	131	18	What pisses me of more is the pieces of chocolate in the vanilla and strawberry! He looks like the type to leave breadcrumbs in the butter, the little shit!
c8cjodc	11	3	I leave breadcrumbs in the butter :( also breadcrumbs is a weird word.
c8clp36	9	2	It's the 'b'. You look at bread, it's fine. Crumbs, sure. It works. But breadcrumbs, the first 'b' is just death staring at the other. Straight up mean mugging that little shit. 
c8cg1l0	197	17	Why don't you just buy a tub of chocolate ice cream instead?
c8chga4	276	29	Yep. The real asshole here is whoever bought Neapolitan.
c8chhdv	33	3	But there's not enough room in the freezer for a tub of vanilla and a tub of strawberry also. 
c8chkh9	41	13	There's *always* room for strawberry.  Throw out the meat and the pizzas
c8chnfe	35	7	I would NEVER throw out my steaks for ice cream!
c8cij2v	5	0	You don't throw them out. You use the need for ice cream space as an excuse to gorge yourself on steak.
c8cinme	5	0	And then later, you use the need for steaks as an excuse to gorge yourself on ice cream. Win-Win.
c8cj7nk	4	0	You are wise sir.
c8chhww	11	0	Because then he'd complain about not having enough variety.
c8cj0zt	4	0	It's like that cheat pack of Gardetto's they sell these days with only the rye crisps, which is the only reason people but Gardetto's in the first place. They don't taste nearly as good out of context. 
c8cj6mb	6	2	Or like the fucking tubs of popcorn with regular, cheese, and caramel. I feel like all these products are meant to create arguments. 
c8cfk58	378	48	What? Strawberry is the shit!
c8cfpoa	79	11	Amen! I'd murder the strawberry too. 
c8cg2zp	33	3	I get neo for my son, he eats the chocolate and I have the vanilla and strawberry 
c8ci4qo	73	23	"...and we share the insulin"
c8citao	27	7	Oh shut up.
c8cfloa	124	12	when I was a kid I went through my sister's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and ate all the cookie dough pieces.  she wasn't pleased.
c8chgjv	94	5	I did this to my brother's Lucky Charms only I ate all the marshmallows and left all the cardboardy bits to him.
c8chhvl	103	7	You bastard.

c8ciiav	4	0	You have no choice come to me my son
c8chljd	23	0	We would have made a good team.  The marshmallows taste like someone figured out how to blend the plastic used to make ping pong balls with the sugar used in Peeps.  I much prefer the crispy bits by themselves.
c8cigys	3	0	I know! The marshmallow bits have the texture of chalk and the consistency of an eraser. 
c8chk54	70	17	You're literally worse than a billion rapist Hitlers.

c8ch2dr	139	17	Joke's on him, Strawberry and Vanilla is the best combination anyway.
c8chrmb	15	6	Have you tried strawberry and chocolate? I'd be pissed he messed with my flavor combo!
c8chfl7	67	13	Vanilla is the shit, but yours seems to be a weird ahade if yellow.
c8cfmwl	48	5	Where can I buy a brother like this? Chocolate ice cream is the bane of my Neapolitan eating experience. I'm chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream all the way.
c8chvb3	35	0	&gt;Where can I buy a brother like this?  Thailand. Get it shipped in multiple packages, it's cheaper.
c8chtp2	22	4	Why is the vanilla yellow?  Did your little brother piss in it?
c8cg8tl	19	5	Next time you should put laxatives in just the chocolate.
c8chifc	5	0	No.  The asshole is the one who buys Neapolitan.  If you want Strawberry but strawberry.  And here's some news, they sell single serve vanilla too.
c8cgyl3	45	15	Am I the only one who doesn't like chocolate ice cream?

c8cfkty	11	3	I didn't even know they made yellow ice cream. What flavor is it??
c8cfsej	12	1	I'm guessing it's Vanilla, but it might be Banana.
c8cfyxe	17	0	my guess is french vanilla 
c8cganh	18	1	my guess is not chocolate

c8chah5	9	3	No the person who bought stupid neopolitan ice cream is an asshole. 
c8ch5lp	4	1	Your little brother did you a favor. 
c8chxc7	3	2	Everyone acts like chocolate is the best. I actually would like it least of the flavours available.
c8chf5b	7	4	Are you kidding?  You're brother left the two best flavors and ate the worst one!
c8cfn5n	1	0	Maybe you bought the kind without any chocolate on accident. It's still separated into parts because you don't do 5050 with that flavor.

c8ch8ar	350	46	she's 91 and has been mississauga's mayor for 34 years. she also helped the city become completely debt free
c8chv3y	188	27	She was also implicated in a massive scandal giving her son millions of tax dollars. But I agree, she was the best thing that happened to the city.
c8cisl1	95	12	Unfortunately she is also the cause of a ton of voter apathy, considering she has basically won every election since World War Two.
c8cjfu0	136	15	As I understand her first foray into politics was the roman senate. 
c8ckr4z	68	14	&gt;Et tu, Hazel?  -Julius Caesar
c8ckjeb	15	3	I'd just like to point out that she became mayor 33 years after WW2 ended, though your point is still valid.
c8ci2gn	52	9	Meh, at least her shady business you can see.
c8ciqv7	14	6	That really overshadows how awesome she is though.
c8cie7m	29	30	A legacy of unchecked urban sprawl and unsustainable development, poor transit infrastructure, massive corruption and general incompetence, and you label her the best thing to ever happen to the city? What Mississauga are you from? Get your head out of your ass.
c8ciyj4	13	4	Wake up, sheeple!
c8cmmpj	3	0	Sadly too many people believe the myths about this woman pushed by Conservatives and the media.  People need to at least read more about her corruption and conflict of interest cases.
c8cj32b	8	2	That was basically the most vague reply you can give.
c8ci0m2	126	17	As someone else pointed out, Mississauga is no longer debt free. I love Hazel and all she's done for this city, she IS a FANTASTIC mayor, and has been this whole time. Conversely though, this city 31 years ago was a giant collection of land owned by the city, that they've since sold off piece by piece to developers. We've now sold something like 97% of it, and the large lump sums of money that were fueling this city over the past 3 decades is drying up.   It's easy to be a good mayor in a growing city with plenty of room for development, but Hazel has left a massive hole that whoever follows in her footsteps is going to have one hell of a time filling back in. Unfortunately, whoever succeeds her will automatically look like a shitty mayor because of the damage she's left. We're slowly hitting a population cap, some of these massive subrubs are going to have to be torn down (particularly in the "downtown" city centre area) in order to make room for high-rises to accommodate the ever-increasing population. The industrial areas are already packed to the brim, and public transit in this city is hands down one of the worst, and disproportionately most expensive transit systems in Canada. City council spent a couple million rebranding and updating the transit system when there were much bigger issues with it that should have been dealt with first.   Again, Hazel is good, but she's not a damn super hero. Granted, she's an inspiring woman.
c8ci938	16	0	I agree, Mississauga public transit is the WORSE. I went to a university in another city just so I didn't need to live there and succumb to the shithole that is the Mississauga Transit System! 
c8ciikt	23	2	Anyone else get a huge desire to play Sim City after reading this?  Just destroy some commercial and put up some industry. Build more bus stops on street corners and upgrade the train system to high speed rail. Smash the residentials and throw in High-Density residentials.  edit:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTJQTc-TqpU&amp;feature=player_embedded
c8ck728	2	1	Honestly, there are far worse transit systems. It looks terrible because the TTC is right there, but look at Oakville. God damn is that system ever terrible. I grew up in Mississauga, but now live in Hamilton, and honestly, Hamilton's just as bad, granted, there are a few really fast lines (commuting is a breeze). You're screwed if you want to get anywhere after hours or on the weekend.

c8ci8no	160	27	Yeah I hate swimming in my piles of money it sucks so much.
c8cjbwp	47	7	It's all about priorities.  You want a swimming pool filled with money.  Others want want to live in place that can't be summed up by the word "meh".

c8chzi1	35	4	You miss Hamilton? That's something I don't hear too often!
c8ci265	22	3	It's a surprisingly beautiful city, and the "Waterfall Capital of the world" as it calls itself due to the 100+ waterfalls it has.  Don't let the industrial section of the harbourfront fool you, it's a pretty nice city all things considered (interesting scenic geography helps).
c8ci486	8	1	I've lived in Hamilton for 18 years! I just moved away, and whenever I tell anyone where I'm from I get a sad "oh... that's interesting" or "should I be worried you'll pull out a knife?"  With that being said, I do love the city. I was just being annoying :)
c8cic0h	5	2	I'm sorry, but that is way too many waterfalls. You need to have a waterfall law in place.

c8cigm7	13	1	Hey, if you can drive in Vaughan (or Woodabriidge!) you can drive anywhere.   And there's a giant, awful mall there, near the giant, awful theme park, north of the giant, awful theatre area.   Good Highland Farms, though!  Edit: typo. 
c8cihhz	6	0	Sounds... giant and awful
c8cik8o	4	0	It is. It really is. Coming from north if Vaughan (King Township) it's always stood between me and Toronto. And it doesn't mean the people are bad, or anything. It's just *sprawl*. All the way up to Teston road now. Ugh. My favourite intersection is now sullied. RIP Weston and Teston. 
c8ck7uc	5	0	After spending some time in the GTA I've found that North York is as far out as I want to go in that direction. Every time I have to go up to Vaughan/Richmond Hill/Markham I sigh.  They aren't bad places by any means and just as everywhere else they have their own highlights, but they just seem so generic. I know that there is quite a bit of industry and major companies up there, but it just seems like you choose to live there so that you can get a more affordable house rather than because you actually want to live there.  Maybe I'm missing out on some kind of identity that I never picked up on while I was there, but I don't think it's the case.

c8chrkt	35	6	I've heard rumours that she has a tendency to drink during the day from contacts in the provincial side.  Regardless, better a lush than the twat we have in Toronto.
c8chuom	47	6	You'd drink too if you were mayor of Mississauga.
c8chx07	16	6	She's not nearly as awesome as people make her out to be. People here just go nuts over her for some reason. Yeah, Mississauga is doing okay, but there's more than one factor that determines a city's prosperity. Most of which have nothing to do with who the Mayor is  Plus, she's pulled some serious strings to keep her driver's license. Despite it being a major safety issue, she'd rather drive and be independent. She frequents the same breakfast place as I do, and every time I see her drive away, I'm thankful that I'm not going to be on the road at the same time as her.
c8ch9ns	11	0	Ha! I met the girl doing the interview! Which reminds me, I was supposed to email her the pictures...

c8cid39	10	6	Maybe because, you know, she's actually a competent mayor unlike Rob Ford?

c8cn0j3	29	4	Maybe she had a bad case of early-boobs?
c8cn9at	35	5	Or she was tall. One thing I remember about the ages 10 to 13 is that we looked like we were ages 7 to 18. A few overweight girls (and some who weren't) were starting to grow breasts in the fourth grade.  Also from the fourth grade, something I'll never forget: a boy in my class brags that he has pit hair. We mock him as a liar. Then he slides back his polo shirt sleeve and lets loose this thick, black pirate's tuft. We were awestruck and horrified all at once.  Those are pretty awkward years.

c8cjyee	46	5	The Tshirt site had very limited options.  I am well rebuked  edit: Holy shit, I didn't realize the tongue in cheek, font comments would make such a stir.  I guess I forgot I was on reddit.
c8cko2o	69	9	dude, its a punk shirt. you're going to choose to conform to the comic sans hate? comic sans 4 lyfe fuck the h8rz
c8ckybi	90	18	A) That's not Comic Sans. It's a sans-serif typeface, sure, but that does not automatically mean Comic Sans. Frankly, it's not even *close* to Comic Sans as far as casual sans-serif typefaces go.  B) Can you give a *single* reason why Comic Sans - or, hell, the actual typeface used, since it seems to have upset you so much - *shouldn't* be used on this shirt, or are you simply jumping on the hate bandwagon without any actual knowledge to back up what you're saying? Seeing as you can't even *identify* Comic Sans, I'm inclined to believe it's the latter. (For the record, I'm not saying Comic Sans is the best choice for this shirt. I'm just trying to call out people who hate on something solely because the internet told them to and they will get free internet points for it)
c8clfpp	16	3	I'm lost.. why is there a hate-bandwagon on comic-sans?
c8clkyr	44	2	In short, it's installed by default on (I believe) all Windows computers and is a "fun-looking" typeface, and as a result you see it quite often - including many places (resumes, official notices, etc.) where a more "professional" font would be much more appropriate. This has led to a (rather unfounded and wildly uninformed, in my opinion) crusade against it, ultimately resulting in the fact that simply replying to something which uses a font that looks moderately like Comic Sans with "comic sans ಠ_ಠ" will cause Reddit to shower you in upvotes.  There is some validity to complaints against it; Comic Sans has poor weight distribution and is very difficult to kern adequately, which pretty objectively makes it a poor font choice. Additionally, while Comic Sans looks pretty decent without anti-aliasing and can be read at very small sizes with AA turned off, does not look *nearly* as good with it turned on (as is generally the default for font rendering on computer screens nowadays).  TL;DR It is a comical font, designed to look like text in comic books, which is often used in less appropriate areas. This makes people very angry.
c8clpc5	42	4	I'm old. Like 32.  I remember back in the day, like 1996 when comic sans was plastered all over everything.  People used it back then because it was cute and quirky and little things like changing your font in internet chatrooms was the key to getting yourself noticed and back then internet chatrooms were like, the best part of the internet because the rest of it was bollocks like lists of fun facts about how dolphins sleep with one eye open or one of the billions of under construction homepages spewed out by aol or geocities.  Back then, comic sans was some hot shit. It was like putting GSOH in a personal ad or something and yet still, it had the faint whiff of retardation then.  Chat rooms always had a couple of random teenage girls with coloured comic sans as their font of choice.  Years went by.  Those girls got older and remained retarded, they also continued using comic sans. Some of them had picked up habits for getting attention like spontaneously throwing in caps iN tHe MiDdlE of SEntEncEs to try and get more attention. Tons of them were now in their early or mid 20's and still hanging out in teen chat rooms, finding that the chat rooms aged 20+ were mostly filled with 30+ people. This fed the already lame vibe they had going.  Chat rooms became dated. Many IM clients began not even linking to them through the main client, they became more of a legacy product of ages gone. Comic sans users however, refused to die.  They spread out, their homelands now in disrepair, seeking solace in blogging communities like livejournal or trying to forge a place for themselves in corners of the internet like myspace. They lurked in these dark corners of the internet, gathering strength until the calling of facebook arose, waking them again into action where they now cling to an age which has long since passed where comic sans was pretty cool but now seems lame in an age of crisp edges and clean typefaces.  tl;dr: too many lame people used it for lame shit over the years.
c8clv82	2	1	As a graphic design student, I'm with you on this. Even when you ask professional graphic designers why they hate Comic Sans they don't give you a complete answer. I personally don't hate it at all but still it's not my favorite. 
c8cj06i	97	18	The butterfly is clearly taking a fat dump, likely on The Man, who is just out of frame. Fits under 'punk' for me!   Butterfly shit, man. BUTTERFLY SHIT.

c8cjm1c	38	5	She's Punk.  On her way to pure.  It's been mentioned, but "lying doesn't count in the Library" is wise.  This girl gets it.  A long time ago, I was once told I couldn't check out "a big kids book" because I wouldn't understand it.  Was "The Boys First Book Of Electronics" and as a third grader, I loved electronics.  Stole that book.  Read it I don't know how many times.  By the time I was in 5th grade, supposedly ready to check out that book, I knew it cold, every concept, every word.  Fuck the man indeed.  All kinds of cute too.

c8cjlvj	14	0	Hopefully she'll never look like Charles Bronson.

c8chtew	856	162	To be *somewhat* fair: how many 5th graders are listening to Dead Kennedys? We can't hate on Beliebers then mock youngsters that venture out.  Just my .02
c8ci5ex	524	68	I wasn't under the impression that she was being mocked. This girl rules! 
c8cjird	121	21	Yes! I'm on mobile, so I had to go back to see what subreddit it was in. When I was that young I thought I was so badass because I would wear fishnets and sew band patches on my jackets, I would hang out at this record store, and the owner would always show me some awesome punk and psychobilly bands, (he wasn't creepy, he was also my neighbor). I look back on it and realize that I was a bit silly and didn't really understand all of the messages these bands were portraying, but I loved the sound of it and the style of that sub-culture. Whatever man, we all have to start somewhere.
c8ckn41	93	43	what's wrong with fishnets and band patches? I'm 25 and I still do that. Its better to sew up a pair of $10 goodwill jeans and make them fit rad and look awesome than go go out and buy a $200 pair of "fashionable" jeans. And I look better than half the people who spend ten times what I do on my wardrobe.   Whoa, I'm getting hella downvoted. Someone is mad about being deceived by the spectacle of high-priced fashion.
c8clgnb	17	2	they're just jealous of our custom jeans.
c8clywr	3	2	Sounds pretty sexy if you ask me.
c8ckwtq	39	9	Except this is fake.
c8clgup	35	4	You get an upvote for realizing this and now that I actually pay attention I realize that Dead Kennedys weren't stupid enough to call anything "The Man".
c8cnhuh	12	4	It was obviously fake, but i think it was a cute and funny idea. I actually can't name any punk bands that ever say the man. it's all the undereducated fans. but Whenever I'm told I'm breaking an unnecesary rule or something I'll still yell fuck the man  tho. (highschooler, obviously)
c8chzqz	91	14	Very true. We all have to start somewhere.
c8cjexy	59	4	I remember asking what lol means in some chatroom.
c8cjwqa	60	12	Oh man, I remember when I was playing Runescape and assumed that lol was a cuss word. Walking around town and seeing the little yellow 'lol' above players heads made me report dozens of them.  I hope I didn't get any of them banned...  I am so dumb back then...
c8cka3d	88	10	&gt;I am so dumb back then...
c8ckrpe	34	2	I were so dumb right now.
c8ckmva	9	0	Sounds freudian...
c8cjlgl	11	0	So what does it mean then?
c8cjo7t	30	2	pretty sure it means Lots Of Love, right guys?
c8cjsgh	61	1	"Grandma died, LOL". 
c8cl5gf	6	0	My mother in law actually ended a text message to my wife about her Grandma being seriously ill in hospital with LOL under the illusion that it stood for lots of love.
c8cjzqb	29	3	No it means Lucifer our Lord!! We have to protect our children from this Satanic worship
c8cj37s	42	11	To be *somewhat* fair: You assumed people were mocking her when they weren't. 
c8cj836	37	15	Seems like the top comment:  &gt;Honestly, this probably is one of the most punk things I've ever read in my life. She's drawing butterflies on the bottom like...seriously, cuss words toward the man...  took a mocking tone. I won't assume too much, because it's the Internet, but I think I agree with meretalk. Instinct would be to mock because the girl only has a half-understanding of what she's listening to, but I don't think she's pretending to understand. The fact that she's trying to learn is admirable.
c8cji1x	5	3	Is sarcastic mocking really mocking at all?
c8cjk55	6	0	Sarcastic mocking is a little too meta for me, I'm afraid.
c8cjgx7	11	6	I don't think the top comment is mocking her, more just making a joke about how she said she's the most punk person even though her tone indicates she is no where near a punk
c8cjjqg	9	3	Which is why I'm hedging, I guess. I don't like to assume too much tone from anything that's written on the Internet, but I was making an educated guess.  On a separate note, she never claimed to be "the most punk person," but rather "more punk than anyone else I have met in life," which is entirely plausible, given that she seemed to be unaware (or ignorant) of the movement before borrowing Dead Kennedys CDs from the library. 
c8cl5a5	6	2	I interpreted it as more of a "rock on little girl" tone, no mocking whatsoever
c8cjnvt	16	2	We're not really mocking her for listening to Dead Kennedys.  It's just funny how she doesn't quite understand the stuff she's listening to.  And adorable.
c8cj21y	78	25	[In Canada it'd round up to .05](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-canadas-decision-to-ditch-the-penny-seems-to-be-good-news-for-all-2013-2)  I just had to say it.
c8cj9si	97	11	Actually we're rounding .01 and .02 down to zero and .03 and .04 up to five. So now expressing your opinion is a free service. Just another way Harper is killing jobs.
c8cjk3s	12	2	So you're saying if I buy penny sweets/candy one at a time, I can have as many as I want for free?!
c8cjoln	34	6	No with Ontario tax it's like 1.15$
c8cjnyz	3	0	To be *somewhat* fair: I mocked her while being impressed.  So yes, some of us *were* mocking her... a little.

c8cijvg	13	1	Next page was when she first listened to GG Allin.  The rest was written in santorum.
c8cjp6j	14	3	&gt; Also, I don't like fascists. I think they are like a cult religion that the man belongs to.   Surprisingly astute. Most people I encounter who embrace fascist principles of organization of society from the top down easily roll over and allow their resources to be co-opted by the fascist controllers AKA the man. This little one has a bright future of starving free ahead.

c8cnkpl	12	0	Last time I got a shot, I was crying before they even gave it to me.
c8cu4n0	1	0	I have done this.
c8coe57	3	0	Ever been to Six Flags?
c8cs1f4	2	0	Over Georgia.  The first time I rode an "upsidedown roller coaster". I must have been seven or eight years old at the time. I was thrilled, and terrified.  Every time we went through a loop, for some inexplicable reason I would bend at the waist and my head was between my knees. It was like I couldn't keep myself up.
c8cu4h0	1	0	Yes. The most humbling experiences of my life are going to theme parks and watching 8 year old kids getting bored on rides that make me whimper just looking at them.
c8ci0f6	30	7	I once got a flu shot without weeping... ladies.
c8cmfp3	11	1	Reminds me of this one.  http://d3agyjohwahf00.cloudfront.net/images/Not-Funny-When-Youre-The-Next.jpg
c8cnkgq	3	1	It's funny...until your next. 
c8cqnce	8	0	My next what?
c8cgvne	33	13	GLOVES!! WEAR GLOVES!
c8cnqo4	14	1	Crazy as it sounds, there is no benefit to wearing gloves when giving injections, so long as the risk of exposure to blood or infectious agents is unlikely (which is usually the case for immunizations).  The risk:benefit doesn't justify.  Hold off on that call to the Medical Board.  Source: [OSHA. Q33](http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&amp;p_id=21010#gloves)
c8cucab	4	0	Not sure if novelty account or coincidence
c8cxg2o	1	0	hmmm interesting. Never knew that. thank you. But i would still prefer gloves :)
c8cxvcl	1	0	I'm with you. And btw, it's different when drawing blood than for giving shots. But then would you a) glove one hand or both, b) change gloves with each immunization or just one pair, even if there are dozens of kids, c) and if yes to b, are you willing to pay more for immunizations to offset the cost?  Having said that, anybody requesting gloves or extra measures for sterile conditions at the Doc's office are usually and happily accommodated upon request. :)
c8d0k2z	1	0	granted it will cost more to have a new pair of gloves with each shot, but the end result is less of a chance of disease and spreading it around. I remember getting my flu shot and watching the people infront of me get it and every time a new person came for it, the nurse took off the used gloves, washed her hands and put on new ones. It makes me feel better knowing that they are careful with disease.  Maybe i am OCD but so far i have not gotten anything bad from the health clinic :)

c8cmxmt	102	34	Shouts out to 90's kids for being the proudest of their generation for no real reason. 
c8cs1tn	11	2	The only people who ever make reference to being "90's kids" as a badge of pride are the one born in '97 and later.  There was a wonderful wonka macro that expressed my feelings on this perfectly:  "Oh, you are a 90's kid?  Please, do tell me about those three wonderful years you have no memory of."

c8cqd4f	11	6	No, YOLO are brought from kids BORN in the 90s. "90s kids" were born in the 80s. Right?
c8cqebz	7	1	Oh is that what it is? I thought you were 80s kid if you were born in the 80s, my mistake.

c8cl0ee	19	2	Is that a spice girl?
c8cl5mc	29	7	That's not just any Spice Girl, that's Ginger. Only 90's kid will understand that.
c8cle62	24	2	She was the most down to earth Spice Girl. None of the other Spice Girls would let you do anal, but Ginger would. 
c8cpi8k	2	0	Since that name reminds me of "Mary Ann", I must be far too old to qualify.
c8cnj8y	8	3	I was born in 1990, and I've never heard that line. Was I the only one whose family paid for two phone lines?
c8co7uu	10	11	Yes, not everyone twenty years ago had two phone lines because hey, one is enough and most people had better things to spend their money on. Your parents however didn't. 
c8cqihf	2	0	I heard it from friends, my parents had cable.
c8cs196	2	0	I'm with you.
c8csbcg	2	0	My parents attempted to go with a single phone line for maybe a month after we got the internet. They learned pretty quickly that it would never work.
c8cnjow	7	0	I hated that shit. I had a 30 min time limit.
c8co5m2	14	3	Sooo you're only a true 90's kid if you had internet? What about actually growing up in the 90's? Doesn't count?

c8crw10	4	1	Society labels you as a "3rd world country" member.
c8couqc	2	1	I was stuck with it until 2009, but I'd still consider it to be more typical to the 90's.

c8cs47c	2	0	i still use a flip phone. No desire to get anything else. I found no need to be on the internet on my phone most of time. $70 a month doesn't sound appealing, my $100 card lasted 6 months last time. :)
c8cqyq3	2	0	One of my closest friends had dial-up until about 3 months ago.
c8cnkkw	3	2	Sorry to say but I saw this about a week ago and this is only 6 hours old so it's clearly a repost

c8cswst	1	0	Could've sworn the landline had priority over the internet, i.e. they could just pick up the phone and you got kicked off the internet.
c8ct52p	1	0	i didnt even get the internet until about 1997

c8cvugm	0	0	Most plungers use a standard broomstick thread. There's fewer different things out there than you'd think.  ...which is handy if you're tall, or things got real bad and the orinal plunger handle broke and you really, really, really need one right now.  (If there are people who don't know: most paint roller handles ('frames') have a broomstick thread so you can stay off the ladder longer. Now combine that thought with a plugged up gas station toilet.)

c8cs1f4	2	0	Over Georgia.  The first time I rode an "upsidedown roller coaster". I must have been seven or eight years old at the time. I was thrilled, and terrified.  Every time we went through a loop, for some inexplicable reason I would bend at the waist and my head was between my knees. It was like I couldn't keep myself up.
c8cu4h0	1	0	Yes. The most humbling experiences of my life are going to theme parks and watching 8 year old kids getting bored on rides that make me whimper just looking at them.

c8cqnce	8	0	My next what?
c8cgvne	33	13	GLOVES!! WEAR GLOVES!
c8cnqo4	14	1	Crazy as it sounds, there is no benefit to wearing gloves when giving injections, so long as the risk of exposure to blood or infectious agents is unlikely (which is usually the case for immunizations).  The risk:benefit doesn't justify.  Hold off on that call to the Medical Board.  Source: [OSHA. Q33](http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&amp;p_id=21010#gloves)
c8cucab	4	0	Not sure if novelty account or coincidence
c8cxg2o	1	0	hmmm interesting. Never knew that. thank you. But i would still prefer gloves :)
c8cxvcl	1	0	I'm with you. And btw, it's different when drawing blood than for giving shots. But then would you a) glove one hand or both, b) change gloves with each immunization or just one pair, even if there are dozens of kids, c) and if yes to b, are you willing to pay more for immunizations to offset the cost?  Having said that, anybody requesting gloves or extra measures for sterile conditions at the Doc's office are usually and happily accommodated upon request. :)
c8d0k2z	1	0	granted it will cost more to have a new pair of gloves with each shot, but the end result is less of a chance of disease and spreading it around. I remember getting my flu shot and watching the people infront of me get it and every time a new person came for it, the nurse took off the used gloves, washed her hands and put on new ones. It makes me feel better knowing that they are careful with disease.  Maybe i am OCD but so far i have not gotten anything bad from the health clinic :)

c8cs1tn	11	2	The only people who ever make reference to being "90's kids" as a badge of pride are the one born in '97 and later.

c8cpi8k	2	0	Since that name reminds me of "Mary Ann", I must be far too old to qualify.

c8cvugm	0	0	Most plungers use a standard broomstick thread. There's fewer different things out there than you'd think.  ...which is handy if you're tall, or things got real bad and the orinal plunger handle broke and you really, really, really need one right now.  (If there are people who don't know: most paint roller handles ('frames') have a broomstick thread so you can stay off the ladder longer. Now combine that thought with a plugged up gas station toilet.)

c8cn8xk	12	6	Every one of your submissions is to circlejerk. You seem to really hate Reddit and everything everyone posts. It's almost like maybe you shouldn't waste all your time on something you obviously hate.

c8cpqwm	2	1	Hey, OP, aren't you the nephew of the guy who voices Ratchet from "Ratchet &amp; Clank"?
c8cliqd	3	6	Look at her eyes. She wants the D(rink).
c8ckyev	11	37	that dude needs to work his shoulders and his traps. His ~~women~~ woman is sporting a better build in those areas than him.  he must have a large penis or she's into skinny dudes  I know what you're thinking guys and gals. "way to generalize women. Saying they all like big penises and they'd only stay with a skinny dude if he had one, or had some sort of fetish for skeletons."  My rebuttal to that...yes
c8cmqg9	10	2	No, I think the downvotes might be from you judging the dude, as well as saying girls won't like him because of his build.
c8cmqp1	5	16	Observations my friend. Observations 
c8cmrhf	2	1	Oh I'm not arguing your point, this is the internet and who cares what anyone else types...pretty sure OP is not offended by what you said.  Just trying to provide another point of view.
c8cms0b	4	7	Word
c8cmxr6	6	2	Oh nice, a conversation about lifting and dick size. What would you say is average dick size, guy? Would you ever recommend skipping a leg day? 
c8cn3eb	2	3	I'd say average is between 5-7 and it really depends on the person and how fatigued their legs are if they should skip a leg day. Everyone's different and some recover faster than others

c8cqz2d	3	2	Is this meant to be dismissive? The lovebird is a member of the Psittaciformes order; it's still a parrot. The "O"P got that part right, still, although I doubt they know better.

c8cnvxn	7	1	You can be the safest rider...it's mostly other cars that don't watch for motorcycles. I watched my friend slam into the back of an SUV that pulled in front of him crossing over traffic (he didn't have time to down shift and stop). I was suppose to be on back with him but I didn't want him to give up his helmet and ride without one..,then literally two minutes later my life changed forever. I blamed myself for a really long time.
c8co53p	3	0	If you'd gone with him and taken his helmet it would've been bad. Please tell me he's ok?
c8cowdh	15	0	No, he died right in front of us (two other bikers) and we didnt even know. We thought he had a fighting chance. The 911 operator told us we had to roll him over (he was face down) to open his airways, once we did, blood was spewing out of his mouth, he leg bone was sticking through the layers of his pants and jeans, his arm was completely twisted and his neck and head and neck was that of a new born baby. I like to tell myself that he died instantly but I'm not sure because they were air-vacing him out of there and doing CPR at the same time. Later at the hospital we found out one of his ribs pierced his heart and he broke his neck. That was 5 years ago and I still suffer from PTSD  the strange thing of it all is that I lost my cousin six months earlier while he was on his bike (a drunk driver ran a stop sign and hit him). That day I was getting ready to meet up with my friends. I was by myself at home and weird thoughts kept popping into my head, my laptop speakers were shorting out...everything was just WEIRD. I took a nap and had a dream of my cousin, I swear he was reaching out to me. I posted a comment on his MySpace page telling him how much I missed him and how I really felt weird today and I wish he was here and how I was drawn to his page for some reason...9 hours later I left another comment explaining I now know why I was drawn to his page.  Either we weren't suppose to ride that day or I just wasn't meant to die and my last second decision to not be one of those dumb girls that rides in shorts and a tube top saved my life. That was so hard for me to live with. The nightmares took years to stop. It was even harder when my friends told me he was thinking of asking me out.    You'll never know how many people's lives you influence until you're dead. I don't live in a small town but it was really comforting seeing "RIP TJ" everywhere and written on everyone's back window. It was super hard being "that girl" who was with him when he died and having people asked me what happened. I eventually just stop going out.
c8cozbc	10	0	*May TJ Rest In Peace*   
c8cp48l	4	0	Thank you Chris-topher  :)
c8cpd0t	1	0	I am so sorry. Thank you for sharing that. I hope you have a good support network around you. It's too much for any one person to deal with on their own. I'm really sorry for your loss
c8cskm3	1	0	That's absolutely heartbreaking... I hope one day you can rest easy knowing it wasn't at all your fault. I sincerely sympathize. 
c8cok74	9	6	I'd still ride my bike.  Knew one guy who got killed a couple of weeks back. Source: [news article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-20140447)   If you ride bikes, it's a feeling like no other, and you'll ride knowing the risks.  If you say 'fuck that', then you're not mentally prepared for the consequences.  I always love the quote from the Simpsons when Homer says: "I could slip on the soap in the shower, hit my head and be killed, Marge!"  I may one day be in this position, or I may die on my bike, or I may die in my sleep with no accident ever.  Who really knows?  I don't think about it much, and have to put up with stick from friends, family and public who say I'm being stupid to ride such a dangerous vehicle (it's a 500cc tourer for fucks sake) and I should be in a car.  I simply remind them that people still die in cars.  Plus you can carry more people to their deaths.  That typically shuts people up.  Kudos to this guy, who's positive attitude is keeping him strong.  Have an upvote from me, and hope you get the gear for the 'chair.
c8crlec	2	1	Dying's not the problem. We'll all die one day. "Not dying" is the problem. Having to live paralyzed for the rest of your life. You may be the world's safest motorcycle driver, but all it takes is one dumba$$ driver to cut you off (and lord knows they are plenty of them), and you'll be toast.
c8cp8k4	1	0	I think I remember this,One of my friends died on a his bike on the way to builth wells, I'm from Merthyr.
c8cpcwj	2	0	Sorry for your loss there. You're not far from me!  Nice roads out that way, especially the Brecon road - taken the wife on the back that way, awesome views.
c8ckttt	44	21	I know three people who've died since high school, and all of them were on a bike.
c8cl7ld	71	11	I've heard a lot of nurses refer to motorcycles as "organ donors" 
c8clccq	115	13	Personally I'd rather get human organs, but I guess I could go for some motorcycle parts. Become some part man part bike hybrid.
c8cnlto	13	2	Personally, I'd like eagle organs so that I could fly like a birdy.
c8cmp07	37	2	Doctor : The bad news is that you need a cornea transplant and we don't have any donors at the moment. Patient : The good news? Doctor : It's just started raining, so won't be long now.
c8cm4k1	18	2	In the medical field, they are commonly referred to as "donor cycles."
c8cnz86	4	1	Donorcycles.
c8covv0	3	1	My mom calls them murder cycles, icu nurse
c8cngwp	5	1	Other common one I've heard is temporary citizens. 
c8co1hy	4	2	My nurse aunt calls them murdercycles.
c8cq7m4	2	0	Years (decades now) ago, my dad had a motorcycle and he promptly sold it after seeing all the people that come through the ER when he was doing his medical school residency. 
c8csrye	2	0	My dad has been riding a motorcycle for the last 45 years and have only had one minor accident when he was sixteen that he walked away from with a couple of bruises. He usually says that the most dangerous thing when driving a motorcycle is when people in cars doesn't look for bike riders and bike riders that drive too fast. I rode with him the first time when I was 6 years old, and I feel completely safe, but I would never ride with anyone else than myself and with him.   I know motorcycles can kill you, but so can cars. 
c8ct9p8	1	1	Doesn't matter how safe you feel or how careful you drive. When you get in an accident on a motorcycle, your chances of death increases dramatically compares to the same accident being in a car. Doesn't matter who's fault it is or how much precautions you take.  Accidents happen every day that are completely out of your control. They are death traps.  And putting a 6 year old on a motorcycle....  No words for that. 
c8cualy	2	0	I'm sorry, I respect your opinion, but I don't share it. As an example, What if you're taking a walk down the street with a car coming up behind you going 70km/h, the car looses control because of snow, rain or a crossing animal, and hits you dead on. Chances are you die immediately. It's not the drivers fault, it's not yours, and there is no precaution you could have taken. Would you say walking is a death trap?
c8culdn	1	0	Walking down a sidewalk alongside a busy road where cars drive fast and there are dangerous things around (snow, rain, wildlife), you are certainly increasing the risk of catastrophe.
c8cvj2w	1	0	There are of course the very slight chance that you will be thrown clear if you're on a bike, whereas the guy in the car is there for the full impact.  Or so some bikers tell me. I'm pretty skeptical. 
c8cvl6p	1	0	It's all relative of course. The more first world the country, the less likely that a driver will do something illegal or stupid.   I prefer my little metal cage with nice "fluffy" airbags when surrounded by idiot drivers.
c8clgd2	9	10	FIFY: I've heard a lot of people refer to motorcyclists as "organ donors"
c8cof67	3	0	That's must be a dangerous bike. 
c8cprw6	1	1	*~slightly tasteless rimshot~*
c8crm8n	2	0	well yeah three people on one motorcycle is dangerous
c8cvmve	1	0	Young, stupid, brave and bikes....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBGUKYWIXkY
c8cl6x9	18	15	dude, i just went down on a freeway two days ago and you couldn't pay me not to ride.   yea shit happens, and I plan to ride less on the street and more at the track where its a thousand times safer. but still riding is pretty amazing
c8cpliw	3	1	Like..the WHOLE freeway? Your gag reflex is legen.   Dary. 
c8clqub	17	38	As long as you're okay with the risk-to-benefit payoff, more power to you.  But you're wrong.
c8cqdzm	1	0	I just got into an argument with a bunch of Redditors claiming that helmets 'did more harm than good' and weren't necessary. Still going to keep using mine!
c8crx2h	1	0	A helmet that doesn't fit right can be more of a risk than it is helpful. But if you take the time and actually get a helmet that fits right and forms to your head, it will be extremely beneficial. There's a lot of science that goes into how they pad their helmets, that's why Arai, Shoei and Bell lead the industry and their helmets are so expensive. They take more time to put effort into making helmets of many padding variety to make them safer and make it possible for someone to find a helmet to fit them perfectly. 
c8ckulc	8	7	That could have been your head.
c8cmlxb	3	0	Shit man, you were watching Reckful earlier!!!
c8cmnk5	2	0	were you watching Reckful few hours ago? 
c8cocdn	4	0	Yea was watching reckful earlier and some one messaged me and told me to put it on reddit :)
c8conxm	1	1	Do you qualify for MMJ?
c8cs9tm	1	0	What became of the rabbit?  
c8cuc9c	2	1	hope the rabbit is okay
c8cvc76	1	0	Are you saying they cost an arm and a leg? 
c8cwdcd	2	0	They can take my legs in the way lol for a good wheelchair racing chair it's £3000
c8cw6sg	1	0	But don't leave the questions too low, or he might not notice them.
c8cwjnt	1	0	Wait... *15 ribs*? Who else's ribs did you break...
c8cwvo8	1	0	you  have 24 ribs lol
c8cx3sr	1	0	Wow, I'm an idiot..... I guess the first 7 ribs are called "true ribs" but everything under those are called false ribs and floating ribs... Had no idea there were so many! TIL. 
c8cyi7j	1	0	Friend of mine is paralyzed too from an accident a couple years ago.  I do have to say he is one of the best attitudes like you.  You should do an ama and I think we can all donate a little bit of our pimpin' money to help you get your racing wheel chair faster.  I sure will support it! 
c8cz5cx	1	0	Yes, they do indeed rip you off. :(
c8d15e3	1	0	Took me awhile to figure out how a tiny fucking rabbit would do that...
c8clv6t	10	0	It's funny because his sense on humor is only from the chest up.
c8codnw	7	2	Made me giggle thanks for that &lt;3
c8cj2gv	24	6	My brother recently shattered C7 to T1 and is paralyzed from the chest down as well. You seem like youre doing great though man. Inspiration to me and my family!
c8cjfik	48	12	I don't get it. 
c8clv53	20	2	He has that scar in his back, presumably from a surgery. The "Insert Coin" is telling us that he's pretending that it's a hole for a coin, as if he was an arcade machine.
c8cnm4t	7	0	I get it now, could t see the scar before 
c8cmyug	14	10	Also the coin represents a new life. Because he had to be revived three times after the crash.  Another thing i'd like to say is that I made that up. (The representation, not the reviving)
c8co37v	4	3	http://weknowmemes.com/2012/06/what-the-author-meant-vs-what-your-english-teacher-thinks-the-author-meant/ Learn a thing or 2 from this...

c8clqzo	63	15	Laugh anyway because he's handicapped and needs our support. 
c8codeh	20	3	Don't need no support,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FMANlc-mz8
c8cr24m	2	0	I love you so much. You're so awesome.
c8cmiyg	18	12	Well I don't think he wants to be patronized.   Laugh if you find it funny, not because you think the disabled need to be condescended to.

c8cmq6b	6	1	I wrecked on a dirt bike in 2007, I'm T2-T6, full use of arms sensitivity  line is about my nipples. [Xray images](http://imgur.com/a/tgont)  I've been wanting tattoos since the accident, a zipper on the spine scar, and xrays of before and after of my spine on my arms.   A sense of humor is good when this shit happens... it's tough at times but being able to laugh at yourself and make jokes that bring the look of horror to peoples faces helps make life bearable. 
c8cmxx4	2	0	Whats the paperclip on the neck for? 
c8cn3dq	1	0	To act as a marker on the x-ray? usually they have L and R plaques, but I guess a paperclip works too if there's nothing available?  
c8cqpvi	2	0	Nah, we wouldn't use a paperclip, because it would be considered an artifact on the image. Most likely it was on the gown/table/clipped to a line for some reason. Cool images though!
c8cud5b	1	0	The docs didn't know the paper clip was there, it was found between my back and the "shell" I was wearing. 
c8cusc5	1	0	Haha, random!
c8clqk6	20	5	Hit a rabbit in a car: "... Did I hit something?"  Hit a rabbit on a bike: Quadrapalegic.  If you're happy, more power to you... But I just don't get it.

c8cnmy1	2	0	You've been on the Internet long enough, friend
c8cm66l	4	1	I don't get it. Where do you want the coin inserted?
c8cpdmt	8	2	That tattoo is going to be even funnier once they do enough stem cell research to get you walking and running again.  I can almost guarantee that you will be walking again before you die my friend.  Until then keep up the good fight.

c8cl4mz	5	1	Dude you epicly rock for being so strong going through all that. My prayers and karma are going to you my friend. :-)
c8cgfx3	4	1	You should get a zipper at the bottom of the scar too! 
c8cljg5	1	0	Dude... :(
c8clpf8	2	0	I sense that you have a sense of humor in the whole thing as you made a joke about the scar.. so here's what I would say to even my best friend if in this situation.. "bro you should have gotten it lower.. at least you wouldn't have felt it".. I try and make people laugh in shitty situations.
c8clpi3	1	0	Jesus Christ,  all the things to break spine would be near if not at the top. Man you are a fighter 
c8cm13o	1	0	Getting a tattoo as a joke. GJ.
c8cm5en	3	0	And you still chose to get a tattoo where you can feel it?
c8cnijc	3	0	I race BMX and have for 13 years. I used to only ride DOT helmets. Then I got a non-DOT helmet. First crash was pretty bad with it. Went to nose tap a jump and my bars snapped from pushing down to hard. Over the bars and on my head. SHATTERED THE FUCKING HELMET. Paramedics say I was lucky not to break my neck of have a brain injury. I was completely fine afterwords. Then i started riding DOT only helmets. I've broken 2 so far, one of them the mouth guard part completely broke off. I was fine. But it got me thinking. What would i do if i became paralyzed. My ultimate conclusion was to get a tattoo that said "please reinsert controller". I'm glade you are taking this with stride man. Stay Strong.  
c8coekr	1	0	Man, that sucks. I am glad you are alive. Good luck and &lt;3.
c8cogs0	2	0	Really cool that you can have a sense of humor about this. But I don't get the joke... :/
c8cogu9	1	0	You're young enough that you'll probaby regain full use of your body again within your lifetime, given medical science advancements. 
c8colsk	1	0	I had similar surgery, I now have a zipper tattoo over the staple marks. 
c8con8j	1	0	Sorry about the incident. You seem to be doing great even with the particular sucky situation. As a newish rider myself. I'm just wondering what gear were you using at that time? 
c8cozaq	1	0	I had full Kevlar equipment on Back protector (did jack shit) lol jacket helmet trousers boots gloves.
c8coxgr	1	0	My brother has been living with the same injury for 29 years. It's not an easy journey but once you adapt you can live a completely normal and extraordinary life! and i see him, as im sure others see you, as an absolute inspiration! Its so great that you havent lost your passion for speed, stay awesome! :)
c8cozvn	2	0	I don't understand how that tattoo is relevant to the situation. Care to explain? 
c8cp74q	2	1	Its above my scar i got on my back from the operations to fix my spine?
c8cpnna	1	0	I am sorry to hear what happened, I hope you stay strong and get through this. But seeing this, I just don't know if riding a motorcycle is worth the risk. Everytime I get the bright idea of getting a motorcycle in the future, stuff like this kills any macho sex appeal the bike has.

c8cwchz	2	0	Shit happens, can't live life wrapped up in bubble wrap
c8cru2d	1	1	Hole thing... Accident pun
c8cshgv	2	0	&gt;Broke my spine in 5 places and became paralyzed from chest down  You should keep out of those places.
c8cskci	1	0	also funny because it's like your lower body only works if you insert the coin hahah great tattoo
c8csog0	1	0	Should have gotten one that says "Out of Order"
c8cuu8o	1	0	Coin Operated Boy
c8cwk9w	2	0	I think everyone is misunderstanding the reference.. Game over, put in another coin to play again.
c8cwmy9	1	0	Hopefully you know that you are a once in a lifetime guy. If that happened to me, I don't think I could handle it. Hopefully you find your calling in life, and become a Paralympics pro, and give a shout out to Reddit for all the support! Hell hopefully reddit will sponsor you!

c8ckqn0	6	4	Well, if the tattoo was somewhere lower, it'd be for /r/gonewild...

c8cgdqk	10	4	Had a motorbike crash at 60mph and hit a rabbit, broke my spine in 5 places also broke 15 ribs both my lungs collapsed and my left leg and had to be revived 3 times.
c8cgz2a	62	15	Is the rabbit okay?
c8cnnrq	8	1	I'm sure he's fine... He went to live on a farm far away with bambi's mom and my cat when I was 10.

c8chbfm	5	3	might i ask how you are typing? 
c8chi9r	22	7	I broke my spine on T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 Which means im a paraplegic I've got full use of my arms and hands and have some use of my stomach muscles

c8cktmh	9	1	And what about Russel, the one eyed muscle below the stomach?
c8cmoi2	1	0	I sure hope Russel's ok. That's all that matters.
c8cn20a	2	0	Fun fact... "Russell" isn't a muscle so many people who've suffered spinal injuries have full use of our good ol' friend.

c8cotgm	4	0	Excellent, saving this for later!
c8crp3h	3	1	ouch. I now feel like a true-dirty-reposting-redditor. thanks for the laugh tho :)
c8cs63p	4	2	OP has apologized.   Faggot levels down 17%
c8cq4v9	1	0	I might be needing these.
c8cmzkj	1	2	Clearly you deserve credit for it then.
c8coacn	1	0	Nope, how about give credit to the guy who took the picture and posted it though?
c8cotag	2	0	As another Edmontonian, I hope this re-poster burns in Hell. Also which bar on Whyte was this for?
c8covgp	2	0	I'm not sure, and its not even the reposting that bothers me. /r/Edmonton is a relatively small sub and its fine that this gets posted to a large Reddit like pics so more people can see it, but at least give credit to the guy who took the picture. Just a cheap karma grab by OP. 
c8ciocy	2	3	Edmonton bros!
c8ceinr	17	2	Beer and free wifi. Can't complain.
c8cepbc	28	6	It's all fun and games until you have to disappoint the group of Irish that stroll into your pub not reading the fine print..
c8ciy3y	17	5	The old Irish dilemma; do I eat the potato now, or wait so I can drink it later?
c8cjjgl	5	0	Is whiskey made from potatoes? I thought that it was just vodka. 
c8cjl2h	2	1	Archer reference. Also I have no idea. Not a big fan of whiskey despite being Irish myself. Always been more a beer man.
c8cjo6h	3	1	I've always been a beer guy too but I tried something recently called Old Overholt, damn decent stuff. Gotta rep my hometown brew right now http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/423/3279 it has an 86 on rate beer too. Boulevard has been expanding like crazy so if you can find Irish Ale in your area, get it. It's my favorite of their non high grav beers. 
c8ck0kb	2	0	I prefer the 80 Acre myself.
c8cq5le	1	0	I like root beer.
c8cm3s6	1	0	God bless Boulevard. I love Harvest Dance and the Brett Saison.
c8cq7v2	2	0	All of their top shelf beers are phenomenal. The 6th glass is my favorite non seasonal or special release of the Smokestack Series. Rye on Rye is my favorite, but I look forward to all of them. Sadly I missed the most recent 
c8ck064	3	0	Whiskey is made from a mixture of grains, much the same way that beer is made. The grain is made into a "mash" by milling the grain. This opens up the grain husks to allow water to wash the sugar off of them, known as sparging, which becomes the "wort". Depending on which process you're performing you then treat the wort differently.  To make beer, you boil the wort, then add hops and anything else the recipe calls for. After the final boil, the wort is then cooled to safe levels, yeast is added and placed into a fermenter. After several weeks you have beer.  To make whiskey, you ferment the wort much in the same way you make beer, but you do not typically add things to it. After it ferments, you then distill the wort, condense it, and cask it to age it.  As for making spirits from potatoes, you can ferment anything with sugars in it.
c8cfeze	10	1	I'd erase the fine print, walk in and claim false advertising.. Then maybe I'd get one free beer
c8cfd3p	2	1	The sign is just a domino waiting to topple over &amp; begun a full-blown riot.
c8cjjky	1	1	I know, right? Imagine the poor bartender who has to explain to the drunken patrons that they actually have to pay. Awkward..
c8cigia	96	41	Stella Artois is not great beer. 
c8cj632	24	4	I think it's pretty good for a pilsner, they should just stop trying to market it as a fancy beer outside if Belgium.
c8cjsnz	17	21	It's a mediocre lager like most others. If you gave me a lineup of a few different euro lagers, I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you the difference, and I have a fairly refined palate.  That said, I really enjoy stouts and heavier beers in general so a lot of the subtlety of lighter beers is lost on me.  Though I do enjoy myself a nice pale euro lager when it's hot out and I'm working on the car or doing yardwork.
c8ck07r	8	9	Yeah but there's beer for tasting and beer for drinking. Stella Artois is pretty mediocre tho.
c8ck0tm	8	16	I don't often drink beers that are made for "drinking" I suppose. Like I said, I drink a lot of heavy stouts and such, but "a lot" is relative. I probably have 1-2 bottles of beer a week, at best. But I probably experience more flavor than most people get in a 12pk ;)
c8ckmpv	7	6	I drank a 12 pack of stella tonight and i have flavor coming out of my ears.
c8cneg0	4	0	But did you beat your wife ?
c8ckpsr	7	11	Go drink one Parabola and tell me it isn't infinitely more complex and flavorful than that Stella.
c8cl7zx	5	5	i'll do my best to come back and let you know my findings
c8cjjfs	15	4	It's the Bud Light of Europe.  It was marketed heavily over here as being sophisticated and people just assumed it was fancy because the name sounded fancy. 
c8cjpi4	15	6	Never understood the notion of consumables being "fancy". You eat them then convert them to poop. That's not fancy. That's just food. Cars are fancy. Cars don't turn into poop.
c8cjvaf	11	0	every car I've ever owned turned into poop in a matter of months.
c8cltce	3	1	Solution: Buy German or Japanese makes
c8cldwt	2	0	former shitty Neon owner here, confirming
c8cn7tc	1	0	Stop buying Fords
c8cnabp	1	0	not convinced make or model makes much of a difference when your budget is around 500 bucks
c8cjrnh	2	0	I thought beer turned to pee?  I'm not sure if pee can be fancy though.
c8cko9z	1	0	Don't forget the non-water components of beer which get turned into poop *and* fat.
c8cjzok	1	0	You are my favourite correct person.  Plan the food at my wedding.
c8ck42y	1	0	[Done.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon_Explosion) Pair with Chimay Grand Cru.
c8cmv35	3	0	Except it has taste and alcohol. Bud Light doesnt have that.   Its not bad beer, its just a basic pilsner.
c8co0ts	1	0	A girl I worked with in a restaurant saw a commercial for the beer and started pronouncing it wrong because "That's how they say it in the commercial!"  No.  No, it's not.
c8codtt	4	0	We make different Stella for our export, which tastes like crap in comparison to wat they sell here in Belgium. I'm deeply sorry for that
c8cptsr	1	0	You stole my comment, but you're Belgian So have an upvote!
c8cr62a	1	0	The US makes some fantastic beers but we mostly export crap. At least you export lots of good beer as well!
c8cn2ut	3	0	It's my second favourite pilsner, right after Jupiler. That said, it's not worth the ridiculous mark-up you have to pay in the States for it.
c8cm4n8	12	6	Oh boy, here we go. Self declared beer experts give their unwanted opinions and argue on what good beer is in 3...2...1...
c8cpyhy	1	0	Yeah, I came to say that the only condition under which I would drink a Stella Artois was if it were free. And I would probably still rant while drinking it.
c8clr4v	3	2	If you're an alcoholic (like most of my family including me) it's pretty good.
c8cizu5	7	5	I'm very doubtful this bar exclusively sells Stella Atrois. Also, the sign comes free. They might even get some sort of financial benefit/discount from Anheuser-Busch if the bar is popular enough to sell a lot of it, as well.  However, thanks for informing us that a globally mass-produced beer is not great.
c8cjim7	5	1	Where did anyone or anything say that the bar serves Stella exclusively?
c8clejw	6	4	because it says "great beer" and toploader suddenly singled out Stella as not being "great beer," as if it was the only beer they have.
c8cq6g2	2	0	Ohh yeah I can see it now.  They do have great beer, it is just the other kinds they serve. The Stella sign is irrelevant. Got it. I had a fever yesterday and was confused. 
c8ckgl9	7	17	Wouldn't drink Stella even *if* it was free...
c8cl0xn	4	1	Try drinking Dutch beer and you will regret that comment
c8cl5yh	3	2	I'll take your word for it. We're spoiled in the PNW.
c8cf4y3	9	3	Textbook case of discrimination against the near-sighted.
c8cjmjn	2	0	Better check your eyesight privilege
c8cj1nh	2	1	was expecting southpark
c8cjq3v	3	0	Advertising at its finest. 
c8ckoud	3	0	As a law student, all I can think is that, depending on where in the country they live, the "fine print" would be too fine. A lot of courts would look at that as a deceptive business practice and say that they knew people would THINK they were offering free beer. Making someone think you're offering something is, legally, usually the same as actually making the offer.
c8clvzv	2	1	Stella isn't great beer. Unless they have some other beer.
c8cja62	7	3	I can't believe that this bar did what other bars have done to make people think that they would actually serve free beer.
c8ciawi	1	0	*always* read the fine print

c8cl94o	1	0	Coming to this picture drunk, I saw it as 'gree beer'.   I frll ffir it. Affective sign. 
c8cloz9	1	1	At least give credit to /r/edmonton man. For anyone wondering this is on Whyte Ave, pretty much our bar/entertainment place to go for clubs. 
c8clpd6	1	0	There is free wifi! Thats all we need
c8cm9k8	2	0	This is the bar on Whyte by Filthy's eh? Tavern, is it called?
c8cmj6p	1	0	The large print giveth and the fine print taketh away.
c8cmoov	1	0	this has to be extremely annoying for the person working behind the counter.
c8cmtgz	2	0	The funniest thing about this is people glancing at the sign would say to themselves "hey, free Stella" and keep walking anyway.
c8cmuuk	1	0	Hey look it's this again!
c8cmxio	1	1	Pfffttt,Stella. Pint of the 'Old Wifebeater' please!
c8cn7s6	1	0	And why are you complaining about free wifi?
c8cnmbl	1	0	Free beer and great wifi?
c8cnosu	1	0	Hahaha - they got your attention, right? As anything else - always read the fine print ! 
c8cnqmm	1	1	Big Titties  Cheap Beer  And false advertising
c8cnvii	2	0	I wouldn't drink that piss if you paid me.
c8coh36	1	0	I really dislike how Stella is marketed as this fancy imported fine beer from the mysterious land of Europe, and has it's own fancy glass. It's like, if the UK imported Natty Ice and marketed it as a fine micro-brew.
c8cohjg	1	0	Belgium is a long way to import WiFi from. Must be expensive beer.
c8cthow	1	0	They're just asking for someone to walk by and erase the fine print.
c8cfogq	3	1	They have [this](http://imgur.com/z7S7bgx) on tap.
c8ciru0	2	2	Erase it so it says free beer great Wi-Fi I'm retarded. 
c8civ0y	2	3	That's what I call being a Cunt to the power of 10
c8cjood	4	1	Since its in chalk, simply rub out "wifi" and "great" and, in a few minutes, join the angry crowd to get a free beer. 
c8ckksi	3	1	I wouldn't have fallen for it.  Because who wants Stella, free or not?     Actually I'm a bit of a Stella apologist, but I recognize that it's TERRIBLE. 
c8cjk7r	3	4	Stella isn't great.
c8ckmo1	1	2	Stella =/= great beer ... You Bastards!
c8clfw9	3	1	stella is a shit beer      i'll slam it to get pissed, but it's far from great
c8clnak	1	2	I ain't even mad.
c8coum5	1	2	My only regret is that I have but one downvote to give for this post
c8cle5q	4	7	Sign should say,  ^^^^Bland Beer  Stella Artois is one of those "import" beers that is exported from it's originating country because it's tasteless shit but has that allure of being foreign. See also Corona, Fosters, Crown Lager, Judas, Heineken (even worse when not actually an export but produced under licence), Asahi, Budweiser (laughed my arse off when I saw it with the expensive beers here in a bottle-o) and Miller, and about another hundred imported "boutique" shite brews.
c8cm73n	1	0	belgian here, in belgium stella artois is considered a daily light beer. of all the pilsners stella isnt that bad. but JUPILER is the best pilsner.  its not really about taste, its about getting drunk anyway taste = trappist , geuze!
c8cm99y	1	0	netherlands here, i don't know a single person that would take stella over a blonde, i.e. leffe. jupiler is ok, cheap like heineken. i rather prefer brand. trappist is wonderful i agree. la trappe quad is probably my fav quad, as i can't get my hands on westvleteren XII all the way up here.
c8co1t6	1	0	I actually like Heineken to use when making beer bread.  It's makes a sweeter bread than other beers...
c8cislv	1	3	At least it's only the beer that's imported from Belgium.
c8clhvg	3	2	stell artois is fucking garbage.  try good beer, like la chouffe, gulden draak, chimay blue cap, or westmalle
c8cmfkg	2	0	I love Gulden Draak. Got a bottle of it ready to drink :)

c8cihkf	4	0	Same.  In fact, I don't think he actually ever says "Science bitch" in the entire 5 seasons to date.  I think it's gonna end up being like the "Play it again, Sam" quote from Casablanca.  It never actually got said in the film (She actually said "Play it, Sam"), but we've had 70 years of people misquoting it.  Oh Well.  Firstworldproblems.
c8cimc0	8	0	This biggest misquote imo is "Luke, I am your father."

c8chp1e	73	13	Except it's [not a real study](http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/medical/a/ogling_breasts.htm)... Fox News is probably not a reliable source.

c8ck9tu	2	0	I'm surprised it was even Fox that reported this considering how "inappropriate" this report would be (or already has been).
c8cjer2	5	1	Look, us rich millionaires who watch Fox News need a reason to stare at our hot secretaries cleavage and not get in trouble, though it seems you peace loving hippies are just trying to ruin all of our fun.

c8cie38	13	9	I'll never understand the fascination most men have with overly-large cartoon-esque breasts. 
c8cjgz6	5	1	Jessica rabbit. Nuff said
c8cj17i	10	3	I will upvote your comment, because I appreciate views which differ from my own. I love breasts. I cannot tell you why, but they are magical. Big boobs are not necessarily the *best* boobs, but they contain more magic in total, even if the density per cubic inch is lower.
c8cj7rl	8	1	It's funny, there are times when someone will say "Those breasts are HUGE!" and I don't think they're that big. But there's a line (for me) where it becomes too much. Personal tastes and preferences is all.
c8cij72	7	5	I wouldn't say most. Those are just nasty.

c8ci38p	5	0	Because his ballsack is musty, duh
c8chqr4	7	2	There's a subreddit that links to posts that are highly likely to reach frontpage based on the amount of votes they get early. Karma farmers go to each post when it's young and post comments so you'll see them early.

Dip ravioli in milk mixture, and coat with breadcrumbs.  * In a large saucepan, heat marinara sauce over medium heat until bubbling. Reduce the heat to simmer.  * In a large heavy pan, pour oil to depth of 2 inches. Heat oil over medium heat until a small amount of breading sizzles and turns brown. Fry ravioli, a few at a time, 1 minute on each side or until golden. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve immediately with hot marinara sauce.

c8cgfmj	620	73	The functional alcoholic was where I found my connection 
c8cjpte	182	23	I remember when RDJ was first announced for being Iron Man, my father told exclaimed in disbelief "Robert Downey Junior? They have a recovering drug addict playing Iron Man?" I just looked at him and went "Dad, when's the last time you read an Iron Man comic?"  He had no clue how perfect the casting was.
c8ckspw	12	3	iron man is a drug addict or alcoholic in the comics?
c8ckwok	65	9	Basically Tony Stark is more likely to invent a new type of vehicle for which drunk driving laws haven't been written yet, than he is to drive sober.
c8cn6yi	12	6	He did. It's called Iron Man. What can they classify a flying full body armoured and weaponized exoskeletal suit attached to the virtual sytem overlord of his multimillion dollar mansion via the cloud? Drunk boating? Drunk driving? Drunk piloting? And if drunk flying is not allowed, there's nothing stopping a guy in a metal suit from taking a walk, even if his suit is a vehicle.
c8ckxlq	24	7	On the off chance that you're being serious - Yes, Tony Stark struggles with different degrees of alcoholism in the comics.   I think Stark's alcoholism was going to be addressed in Iron Man 2, but ended up being rewritten into that green stuff he drinks throughout the movie for reasons that are never really explained. It looks like Iron Man 3 is going to be a lot darker than the first 2, Stark's alcoholism would fit pretty well into the story after the events of The Avengers
c8cl4aw	16	1	The stuff he was drinking was counteracting the poison from his power thing in his chest. It was giving him heavy metal poisoning. It wasn't enough to stop it, just slow it down. That is why he had to make the new element to power his upgraded power unit.
c8cp8pu	3	0	That part drove me nuts. Why does he keep that power unit in his chest!? In the first part of the first movie he was kept alive by a car battery. He only needs the super powerful thing to power the suit. He could probably make something reasonable, but not radioactive, considering that he converted a power plant into something that can fit into the palm of your hand while in a cave. EVEN IF HE COULDN'T, carrying around a back pack with a car battery in it would still be leagues better than dying.
c8cl61u	7	2	&gt; I think Stark's alcoholism was going to be addressed in Iron Man 2, but ended up being rewritten into that green stuff he drinks throughout the movie for reasons that are never really explained.  Outside movie context; Marvel and Disney. They've got a newfound star and franchise on the line. They're not going to risk their image by attaching alcoholism to it.   I may be a bit presumptuous with the following comment, but I predict by the time this Marvel cinematic saga is over, you're not going to find many daring stories told in terms of mature themes/characterization. 
c8cln3e	18	1	They showed him blitzed out of his mind shooting things with his chest repulsor at a party, then having a having a hangover come to Jesus moment with Fury at a donut shop. Also, throughout the three movies Tony Stark is *always* drinking (martini bar in the weapons case, pouring himself a scotch when confronting Loki, etc); they haven't made it the central driving motivation, but it's not like it's been hidden either. 
c8cl546	5	1	He's an alcoholic. There's a great story called Demon in a Bottle that deals with it. 
c8ckr8s	26	8	I love RDJ!

c8ckfuh	15	3	Worked for Denzel.
c8ciq2f	293	45	I'm not much of a comics guy, but my understanding is that Stan Lee created iron man, basically on a dare, that he could create a character that was a complete asshole, but that people would grow to love. The complete opposite of guys like captain America, batman, superman, and other typical good guys.
c8cjii2	154	21	you are correct. he was made an arms manufacturer basically to see if he could still sell to the hippies/youth movement
c8ckg14	84	16	Stan Lee could make a super hero out of literal human feces and it would most likely sell.
c8ckks2	61	8	Sure.  Take The Thing, but instead of making him rock, make him shit.  It's essentially the same concept.
c8ckoer	66	6	Except I don't eat rocks.
c8cl3gp	17	2	I see what you did there. And it disgusts me. 
c8ckjyk	18	3	&gt;Stan Lee could make a super hero out of literal human feces and it would most likely smell.
c8ckoge	8	1	It would smell fucking awesome!
c8cjovx	26	2	I wouldn't say batman would be an opposite, more like and "7 on the pH scale" if you will. He's not an asshole but he isn't exactly best friend material 
c8ckdw2	22	5	Yes, but batman refuses to kill anyone or directly allow anyone to be killed. At some point, you have to ask "batman, how many more people must die before you just ice the joker yourself?"  He will inevitably escape and end up killing more people and you just keep throwing your baterang around and putting him back into Arkham.  
c8clg3q	36	2	First of all, batman did kill when he was first created, but the whole not killing thing was an editorial mandate to keep his comics from getting too dark, they've done well with it.  Remember that Batman is about psychology and insanity. Batman knows he's not right in the head, and his vow to never kill is very very important to him, it's the only thing that separates him from his foes. Sure he could find a good reason to kill the joker, hell Commissioner Gordon would probably be fine with it(Keeping in mind that Batman's vow to never kill is the ONLY reason the GCPD even tolerate Batman). But if he makes an exception now, it will be easier to make an except another time. It's a slippery slope to a very dark path, and as brooding and angry as Batman is, it may not take long for him to become the Punisher.
c8cmi2l	4	1	I get that Batman has a thing about killing that prevents him from ever icing his villains but what about the authorities in Gotham? Surely they are sick of super villains killing hundreds of people every other week for some dastardly scheme. I'd imagine the whole city would bring back the death penalty in those kinds of circumstances.
c8clbas	4	0	This is basically the premise to the dark knight returns part 2. Pretty decent movie, trailer kinda misleading but they managed to slip a side of superman in we don't see often. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUyQlvdbANQ
c8cjeod	28	2	Anybody got a source for this? Would like to read more.
c8cjhl5	146	17	&gt;I think I gave myself a dare. It was the height of the Cold War. The readers, the young readers, if there was one thing they hated, it was war, it was the military....So I got a hero who represented that to the hundredth degree. He was a weapons manufacturer, he was providing weapons for the Army, he was rich, he was an industrialist....I thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of our readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him....And he became very popular.  Quoting Stan Lee from the DVD extra's of the first film.

c8cj5fy	96	24	Don't care. Sexy.
c8cjv7e	34	6	Tony Stark's whole cast of characters are public figures. Pepper is a CEO and she can hire bodyguards and stuff. Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, Lois Lane, and Batman's supermodel girlfriends are probably a little more vulnerable. 
c8ckbzw	42	7	When was the last time a bodyguard/cop/army guy in a superhero movie ever do anything other than fire his weapon ineffectually?
c8clhf8	16	1	Well agienst a super villain body guards are useless, but secret identities are also largely useless vs super villains. The secret identity is mostly to stop random thugs and crooks from causing problems. To see why not having a secret identity can be a problem, see the fate of Hollis Mason in Watchmen.

c8cjec8	85	6	It took decades for Iron Man to be out to the public with his identity. Decades. He once erased the entire world's memory to protect his identity. When he finally did come out to the public as a superhero, he was the Secretary of Defense and effectively had the government, the people he feared would come after him and his tech, at his disposal. It's not that daring when you're the richest fucking dude in the world and have the beck and have the US government at your disposal. 
c8ckbfo	8	1	Thank you, I had to go way too far down to find the first comment that wasn't just going off the movies.

c8ciubu	116	22	Re-watching the old ones made me realize that I don't like Toby.
c8cixsd	97	20	Yeah Toby was painful to watch. His spider-man wasnt funny and his Peter Parker was almost physically painful to watch. No one is that awkward, especially someone who is secretly a superhero. Sure Peter is supposed to be a somewhat awkward nerd, but he was never that bad. Toby is just boring, and neither spider man nor Peter were ever supposed to be boring. 
c8cj88x	56	26	I actually liked his portrayal better than the new one.   Although I will admit that Spiderman 3 was a travesty of epic proportions..

c8cjapk	32	7	The only reason I like Toby is because it seems like he can't believe that he's acting in a movie either.
c8cir3y	49	38	Spiderman 2 is the greatest comic-book movie of all time, and I will fight anyone who disagrees!  Seriously, I thought this was common knowledge until recently. At which point I guess I am just old. But seriously, that is the best shit.
c8cizfo	40	6	&gt;until recently you mean until The Dark Knight came out?
c8cljhq	5	1	The Dark Knight isn't really a comic book movie so much as it's a movie about a character that originally came from a comic. The Christopher Nolan Batman movies, while very good, differ wildly from their source material, not just in details but in many of the overarching themes.  The Spiderman trilogy stuck much closer to the themes and ideals of the comic book, even the third one. It's main problem is the same problem with the comic books, Peter Parker isn't a particularly good or interesting character, he's a whiny self-centered jerk who only does hero stuff due to lingering guilt, and never experiences any character development.
c8ciwkn	11	6	I agree. Loved it.

c8cidxc	515	86	Iron Man is just a douche. It's just the nature of the Iron Man universe that Pepper never gets whacked. Drop those two in Gotham and she'll be strapped to a chair in a warehouse full of oil drums in about 4 hours.
c8cj8tc	36	5	From the wikipedia article:  &gt; Stark entrusted Pepper with a special remote that could shut him down. However, Pepper was tortured and was forced to hand it over. The trauma caused her to miscarry. Iron Man was able to deal with the remote, but felt guilty that he had placed her in such danger. After [Pepper's husband] sustains massive injuries in a fight with Spymaster during the Civil War story arc, Pepper requests that Tony turn off [her husband's] life support . . .
c8cjajh	18	3	For a second I thought I was reading a MASSIVE spoiler.
c8cjgff	9	1	And this is why you need a secret identity. &gt;_&gt;
c8cj0mf	81	12	I dunno. From what I've seen (the Iron Man movies) it seems more like instead of concealing his identity, Stark just conceals his relationships. He and Pepper never seem anything more than professionally involved in public. Him and Pepper? Pepper and him? God damn it language.
c8cj4ju	45	9	He and Pepper.
c8cjcg4	51	12	I'm a pepper, she's a pepper, he's a pepper, we're a pepper, wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?

c8cjpsu	46	4	drop Iron Man in Gotham and he'll smash joker's face in  The villains of Gotham were not meant for a hero like him
c8cju78	34	3	In a straight up fight sure, but that's not how most of the Gotham villains fight.
c8ck73r	53	5	True, but Batman doesn't kill. Stark would just launch a rocket through the Joker's ribcage and call it a day. Bane would have a hard time breaking Iron Man's back, and Scarecrow's gas wouldn't get through his suit.  As others have pointed out, Iron Man's not really compatible with Gotham.
c8ckhvl	18	2	So really you're saying he'd just god mode the shit out of it :)
c8ckotk	18	0	If you look at DC's more popular superheroes like Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, etc., most of them don't kill as a matter of personal ethics. This allows villains to be weaker overall, because losing merely means they'll go to prison (or the Asylum) for a while rather than die.  Then look at Marvel's heroes. Sure, you have relatively goody-goody ones like Spiderman and Captain America, but then you've got Wolverine, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and a slew of others that would just as soon crush the Joker's laughing face than throw him in prison.  Obviously, DC has its share of antiheroes, and Marvel has its share of goody-goody heroes, but in general, the heroes in Marvel tend to be more powerful and/or more willing to just kill someone if they don't behave themselves.

Because lets be honest, who cares about killing the bait?) In either case, it is the nature of comic books in both cases that the hero would then succeed in freeing her, and after some harrowing near death moments, escape with their own life. 
c8cj5o2	58	3	Gwen Stacy died once.   &gt;The death of Gwen Stacy had an enormous impact in the world of comic-book fandom. Before her, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so catastrophically; nor did a loved one of the superhero die so suddenly without warning. Because of this, some fans and historians take the death of Gwen Stacy as one marker of the end of the period they refer to as the Silver Age of Comic Books.  Just an example. The heroes don't always save the girl. However, my comic book reading is pretty much limited to Batman. So, it could be a major exception. 
c8cjuh3	75	9	Gwen Stacy didn't just die, Spider-Man *killed* her. The Green Goblin throws her off a bridge and he doesn't have time to dive after her, so he shoots his webbing to try and catch her. He ends up hitting her leg, and the sudden stop of momentum causes her [neck to snap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spider-Man_Death-of-Gwen-Stacy.jpg). She was going to die either way, but only one of those ways has Spider-Man being the active instrument of her demise. That shit is *grim*.  
c8ck5a5	12	1	Jesus, that is grim... he's all happy he saved her and everything, too.
c8cjvlo	8	1	Exactly the point. It's very dark. 
c8cjy44	7	1	You were definitely right. Honestly, I just like explaining that scene. It's my favorite part of any comic book ever because it's was so unexpected at the time. You can even see in the panel how he's patting himself on the back, not even realizing what he'd just done. Such good storytelling, right there.
c8cjkl0	20	0	Depends on the nature of the comic book.  Batman is a prime example where he *hasn't* rescued the person every time. Jason Todd's death is considered possibly his greatest failure, and then there's Barbara getting shot through the spine and paralyzed.
c8cjlnd	4	0	I agree.  My point was less about the success, and more about the variety of ways that villains would take advantage of such a blunder as revealing your public identity.
c8cj0j5	141	24	Didn't watch the second batman movie did you
c8cj394	73	14	&gt;it is the nature of comic books
c8cj5ml	86	14	Don't read The Walking Dead do you?
c8cjzfi	33	0	Or more aptly, The Killing Joke or Death in the Family.
c8cjdsk	6	2	I'm waiting for that moment in the serie
c8cjjxd	25	5	Wasn't Batman intending to save Rachel though and not Harvey?  I thought the Joker told the Batman the opposite addresses because he knew he would save Rachel.
c8cjooy	30	3	He did.
c8cknem	4	0	But...but...he said he was a man of his word!
c8cjeb7	6	1	Or the girl dies, but they just retcon the shit out of it to where it never actually happened or it was a clone.
c8cj26y	9	2	Apparently, you haven't seen the Iron Man 3 trailers.
c8chg1r	40	3	So you've read the Civil War series then?
c8ciaqc	58	6	Tony was such an unlikable douchebag in Civil War, well actually he is usually an unlikable douche in the comics but Civil War takes the cake.
c8ciw7p	27	1	If you think he was a douche in civil war, he was even worse in World War Hulk.
c8cixws	48	3	Everyone was a douche in World War Hulk. 
c8ciznh	21	0	Strange at least owned up to it.
c8cj8on	14	0	So did Xavier. 
c8cjvyv	5	0	Fair enough, but without Iron Man none of it would have happened (if im remembering correctly and I hope I am)
c8ck2zt	3	0	Yeah, it was pretty much his idea to shoot Hulk into space but he got the Illuminati to back him. 
c8cily5	11	2	To maybe reach too far:  Newtown sort of puts the whole incident in perspective - Iron Man actually has a pretty good point. If you read the whole thing as an allegory for gun control - and I am pretty sure that is how it is to be read - it makes a lot of sense. Neither side looks good in the aftermath. 
c8cinl9	26	1	Putting aside the political aspect of it, the way Tony bullied Peter into revealing his identity and putting everyone he loves at risk makes him the biggest douche out of the whole thing.
c8ciosv	14	0	Yeah, and I thought that was actually a fairly solid character development for both Iron Man and Peter Parker. But it gets undone, because magic. WTF.
c8cir72	7	0	At least they had some type of explanation for everything that happened in that event being undone.  Did you read Fear Itself?  Two weeks after that event ended everything went back to normal.  Bucky going back to being Winter Soldier was about the only thing that changed.  The writing and art were terrible...my god I can't believe I wasted money on that crap.
c8cjgdy	4	0	Dude, Bucky fucking "died" in Fear Itself, right? And I use the quotations because I'm pretty sure he was back as Winter Soldier by the end of the month. Such a terrible storyline. 
c8cik2z	4	0	I came here to mention the Civil War as well. That kind of thinking can cause issues. 
c8cjx35	5	1	I've read Civil War.  Tony Stark is still my favorite.  Tony Stark is real- he fucks up, and when he does, it has actual consequences.  He's funny, and a bit of a jackass, but at the end of the day, Tony Stark is trying to do the right thing, he's trying to do what's best for everyone.  But it's a little like the runaways say- sooner or later, you start being an adult, and you get corrupted.  You get to certain level of the Marvel Universe, and you're knee-deep in shit, and there is no right answer, no easy solutions.  Tony Stark is my favorite because he tries.  Superheroes fucked up, and a town full of people died.  You can't have these people with outrageous powers running around, beholden to no one.  But are you really going to lock up all your superheroes?  Breaking up families, forcing them to work for the government?  I don't know what the right answer was in the civil war.  But Tony Stark took the stance he did out of sympathy for the parents of the children who died in the fallout.
c8cjq4d	14	0	The irony is the iron man suit is the best disguise of those pictured.
c8chrfn	38	3	superman sucks at disguises.
c8ck5bz	21	3	It actually makes more sense in the comics. He compresses his spine (SILVER AGE OF COMICS) down to like 5'6", and, [as shown,](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G0bTnfRrFsY/TiX9GOK6uDI/AAAAAAAAAII/_hKmcHJLN94/s1600/clark_kent_all-star_superman.jpg) puts on a whole new persona when he's Clark Kent. It's not like he just puts glasses on and calls it good. Besides, nobody looks in plain sight, anyway.
c8cklot	5	0	Wow that's awesome never knew that. How does he compress his spine though like does that mean he could grow taller than his normal height if he wanted to?
c8clqm9	6	2	'cuz that's what's keeping him from being recognized, a few inches.  "You know what, Clark?  You look a lot like that Superman fellow!  But there's no way you could be him because, from what I've seen as he flies by at Mach XXXXX from miles and miles above me in the sky, that dude is a couple inches taller than you.  So there's just no way..."
c8cixmn	35	5	You clearly haven't read any comics, ever.   Masks are not to protect themselves but the ones around them. The only one doing it obviously wrong is Peter Parker since he fakes he is friend of Spider-Man making the mask useless.
c8cjcrp	19	0	Kent does this with Superman as well. 
c8cjii6	12	3	Superman is too powerful to care about that. Superman has super ear and can respond to the calls of Louis, Lana, Perry, Jimmy or anyone else.   Spidey has super spiderpowers that won't even help him  get home in time to save aunt may or MJ if by some amazing miracle he knew they were in danger. Same with Ironman who has the power of supermoney and if say Pepper or Jarvis ever got endangered there's no way he can be there to protect them. Superman can.  DC's Identity Crisis does a great job explaining "why do they have to wear masks?"
c8ckozi	7	2	Isn't Jarvis a computer?
c8cluwn	5	0	in the comic he's an old dude
c8ciuym	18	1	These Iron Man movies didn't completely follow the comics or shows, he revealed his identity as away to do what they wanted in the movies without having to follow the comics exactly.  Kind of like using an artistic liscence.
c8cjos9	20	1	IIRC Downey Jr. did an insane amount of ad-libbing in this movie, so having the movie deviate from the comics seems fairly legit.  At the same time, I think that his knowledge about what it is like to have various drug addictions (including cocaine and alcohol, among other drugs) really helped solidify his performance.  To be honest, the first movie made Iron Man a tie for my favorite superhero along with Batman (from "The Animated Series"/"Batman Beyond").
c8cjybh	9	1	  The first movie got me into comics.  It opened a whole new world of media for me.  I have other superheroes I have grown to love, but Tony Stark will always have a special place in my heart.
c8ckeql	9	0	Whenever I think about it, Stark is the most relateable superhero out there other than Captain America (in C.A.'s case, you have to assume that they invented better ways to get someone out of cryogenic sleep than "[throw in a giant microwave like a gas station burrito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5jA03YCtLY)").  Imagine that one of the bigger weapon companies of today (for example, let's say "Lockheed Martin") had most of their inventions come from their CEO's mind, and that CEO had a son with a similar IQ and creativity but no desire to work for a living.  The CEO dies while the son is in his teens, the company's board of directors takes control, the son just keeps on partying up until he gets kidnapped by terrorists that used his own company's weapons on him.  The son then uses his biggest asset (his brains and money) and starts to use it to try to stop those who misuse his products or hurt anyone close to him.  Not even Spider-Man comes close.  Parker is supposed to be a nerd, but he apparently forgets physics before attempting to save Gwen Stacy from the Green Goblin.  He is always struggling with money issues, even though he could easily make billions by selling his web tech to police units (can you say "Spiderman Army"?).  Finally, he constantly worries about the people close to him being attacked if he ever reveals his secret identity, and yet they are all still getting attacked anyways because he is constantly making himself famous as "the guy who takes pictures of, and talks to, Spider-Man".
c8ckmk6	8	1	For me the disconnect with Spidey is he's given his powers by luck.   Tony has to work for his, which goes against his whole life of not really working for anything.
c8ck41y	7	0	I don't think there's ever been a more perfect fit for a superhero than Downey Jr. to Tony Stark. They are truly each other. I am fairly certain Wizard did a "casting call" back in the day that had him as Iron Man. It always seemed like that's how it should be and when it was announced that he was going to be Tony I think everyone felt that something was finally right in the world.
c8ck6r9	14	2	Also he made himself into a hero, he never went through that annoying ”I never wanted this power” phase that I oh, so hate, I mean, if *I* had powers, I'd be like ”fuck yeah!”
c8civwi	13	1	Who's the third one?
c8cjdxi	8	0	Peter Parker/Spider-Man as portrayed by Andrew Garfield in the 2012 movie "The Amazing Spider-Man"
c8cjpud	11	1	There's nothing great about Iron Man/Tony Stark (particularly in the comics, if you bother to read them).  Robert Downey, Jr. deserves a massive amount of credit for breathing life into this mediocre character in the films.  He's a riveting performer, both for his natural wisecracking delivery and his ability to shift to believable drama in an instant.  I suspect he could make almost any character interesting.

c8ciwpo	34	9	one of the billions of reasons as to why Batman is the best superhero
c8cj9ku	20	1	Batman's definitely missing [something](http://i.imgur.com/KbRGLuP.jpg).
c8cj7f3	26	2	Not to mention the fact that he has the capacity to kill all of the other ones. IIRC, in one universe he had a plan for if any of the other super heroes went rogue. A way to kill them. I think this was in the Justice League universe.   Edit: Typo.
c8cjj06	21	0	Technically each one of the heroes could kill all of the other heroes, it just depends on which one is the writers favorite. Also Batman doesn't kill.
c8cjmro	7	0	That's true. I don't recall ever seeing Batman outright kill someone, although someone who's a little more savvy with the comics might. Sure, make them paralyzed, break lots of bones, cause lots of pain, take them out of a fight with pressure points or any gadget he has on his person, but kill them? Not any that I can think of.  I can't think of many instances when Batman has actually been malicious enough to try and kill a main villain fully, except in Hush Vol 2 when Gordon had to actually hold him at gunpoint to stop him from crushing Joker's windpipe.   Although, from what I understand, in the first comics he carried a gun and would kill people only when absolutely necessary. 
c8cjefc	5	0	It's a big part of one of the animated movies. Can't remember which one.   Or was it the tv show? 
c8cjhq2	8	2	Justice League, its the final season. At the end batman retires and Justice Leage Unlimited begins.
c8ck31z	5	0	Professor Xavier also kept a contingency file on how to kill all of the x-men, including himself, if they ever went evil and became a threat. Xavier's file had a blueprint for armor that would protect against his psychic powers, for example, which would come in handy if he turned into Onslaught again.

c8cj6hm	5	1	You do know that Ironman have kept a secret identity for a few decades right?  Hell, he's made several attempts to revert his status to secret.  So he actually care about his identity just as much as these guys.
c8cjva5	5	1	Except for the fact that Spider-man unmasks himself during Civil War (http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war.jpg), Bruce Wayne pretty much says he's Batman when he announces Batman Inc (http://www.blogcdn.com/www.comicsalliance.com/media/2010/11/bmrob16dylux-37-copy.jpg), I mean if you can't see through that, you're a bufoon. Plus, there's the issue of Superman being Clarks actual identity, and Clark Kents "Glasses, Daily Planet, lovable doofus" persona is his "costume"; so really everyone already knows who he really is.
c8cifus	24	27	This is why I hate iron man, actually.  He's attention hungry and just annoying.  A great hero does things because it is the right thing to do, and needs no reward.  
c8cixe0	59	5	But that's why Iron Man is awesome, there are to many stereotype heroes out there. When I first saw Iron Man (before reading the comics) at the part at the end where he was reading the coverup story I didn't care because he was going to deny it and it would be the same thing rehashed from a hundred different heroes, then he said "I am Iron Man". At that point Iron Man instantly became my favorite and that part became the best part of any Iron Man movie yet.

c8cgeap	260	92	My weakness is women who take their clothes off for money. There's something so comforting about them. There's no dancing around it, no false airs of propriety, no hang-ups about whether whipping out their tits at a particular moment is too premature.   Most of the girls in my high school were prudes. We had a lot of religion in my town. Most of the girls were saving themselves for marriage, or at least telling others they were. I vividly remember seeing a girl's bra strap when I was in 11th grade. That this was a memorable event reveals the prudishness of my high school class.    There was a Mexican restaurant my family and I would frequent. And right next door set up shop a "gentlemen's club." We'd sit in one of the booths, eating our refried beans and enchiladas from a scorchingly hot plate. My mom would talk about her day at work. My dad would drown the stresses of the day in a tall glass of beer. And I'd watch as the girls arrived for work next door.   They always drove beaters. They arrived in a flurry of garishly colored revealing clothing and sunglasses, even if it were cloudy out. I imagined they all smelled nice, too. At home, they were moms, wives, daughters. But when they entered the club next to my favorite Mexican restaurant, they were temporary lovers who offered reasonably priced companionship for 10 minutes (or until the end of a song).   My childhood lacked any sort of intimacy, any physical closeness. I was never breast fed as a child. Back then, my mom was reasonably attractive and had giant breasts. But the very idea of breastfeeding was disgusting to her and she made a point of telling me that all the time. My whole childhood, the very idea of touching me seemed to disgust my mother. But as I entered adolescence, she'd often walk into the bathroom "accidentally" while I was showering. She'd stand over me when I was doing my homework. No bra. Her hard nipples rubbing against my back. Once, after drinking heavily, she'd even grabbed my dick through my shorts but immediately apologized. I found myself sniffing her underwear from the clothes hamper when she was at work. I'd jack off wearing a pair of her discarded stockings. I even found a tape my dad made of her topless and I played it again and again, blowing load after frustrated load watching the woman that never wanted to be close to me teasingly shake her giant breasts for the camera.   I guess my interest in strippers came from the frustration I had with my mom. It was so obvious that she wanted to fuck me. But society said that wasn't possible. The closeness I yearned for as a child manifested itself as sexual attraction in adolescence. And each time I'd take a bite of a burrito, staring at the wonderful creatures that manifested themselves next door, I thought of each of them as single moms. With a young boy at home, eager for the intimacy she shared so readily for a couple of dollars. An intimacy that could be bought from complete strangers, but that society forbade between mother and son.

Young child received no intimacy from his mother (something that has been proved to damage a child psychologically), as an adolescent his mother makes sexual moves because she never had an intimate relationship with the child, and confuses the fuck out of him. Now this child, now a man, sees a stripper and thinks of the intimacy they give out as part of their job and loves them for it because the intimacy he never received as a child.

c8cgkv8	46	16	I didn't get it at all. Now I've read the comments, I'm guessing that the joke is the little kid is pretending to be a pole dancer.  Yeah.. wow.
c8cgtxg	26	4	I thought it was a joke about the trials of parenthood: she just learned to walk and is now getting into all sorts of trouble...hence the dad's resigned/exhausted expression.   Then I thought, well at least he has a beer to console him.
c8cjfpl	10	1	It's just a joke, you don't have to look too much into it.
c8cgca7	5	1	I must be getting old... "So it begins"... Looks like she's trying really hard to fill her diaper, but just can't get there.

c8cfjem	11	2	Anyone else think that guy looks like Jarrod Schulz, from Storage Wars?
c8cfmjs	4	1	YUUUUUUP! Read through all the comments looking for this. Looks like him and dresses like him. 
c8cg8se	3	1	Because pole dancing.
c8cg230	10	3	All this gender morality talk? I thought the picture was about the dad facepalming, to the fact that his kids look like they are being annoying
c8cg2tp	9	4	I had no idea what the caption meant until I started reading the comments.  Really guys?  What makes this more than just a kid standing on a table that has an umbrella pole?
c8cjqy4	4	3	This statement makes me think you know very little about comedy.  Let me explain:  1) Picture is taken of child on table touching umbrella pole.  2) OP sees picture thinks to himself that this is similar to something else.  3) OP (somewhat) cleverly creates title based on the situation's similarity to pole dancing.  This, my friend, is basically how comedy and jokes work.
c8cg57k	5	3	I was like, baby's first steps? What's so funny about that? Are babies notorious for going through a "I'm going to walk all over your picnic table phase"?   Maybe I've actually managed to pull my mind out of the gutter. At least for babies. 
c8cg89b	8	2	i had no idea what the joke was till i read the comments

c8cmd9e	2	1	If you turn this in to a meme, I will find you and kill you
c8cetsl	113	97	This appears to be a restaurant in which case you are all terrible people/parents for letting your child stand on a table where there is food. Have some respect, please.
c8cfzgx	37	8	You eat off of plates, not straight from the table.   It's outside, it's not like that table is sterile. 
c8cg8ju	14	4	That child is barely walking age, too, and is still getting strollered everywhere. The rubber of those shoes is cleaner than the hands of the adults that sit there...
c8cfud2	80	20	look at all that food on the table, LOOK AT IT!!!!
c8cg16f	13	2	http://qkme.me/3sxb38
c8cfxbw	27	8	This also appears to be some sort of chll bar / grill based on the 4:3 ratio of alcoholic drinks to adults, the outdoor atmosphere, and the blackboard invitite on the sidewalk...so I would say general enthusiasm and jumping on the tables is actually encouraged and welcomed. 
c8cg0jj	7	1	Thank god for plates!
c8cgb7s	9	2	Yeah, an outdoor table that I'm sure no bird has ever shit on. 
c8cg4jn	24	15	In my own little world this is the top comment.  Everything else aside, letting your kid walk around on a table is trashy.  It just is.   If a kid steps on a table you tell them that they shouldn't stand on tables.  edit: I will say that they might not be terrible people, but this type of behavior is just... uncivilized.
c8cg748	5	0	Probably phrased better than what I said.

c8cixy3	15	0	You aren't going to be delivering the same sound quality that the movie can provide bass wise. (Mind you, I have a nice and extremely expensive theater in my area). Not only would you have to provide a good pair of headphones to get the same sound quality, but to deliver the bass, they would need a sound card capable of delivering that style of sound to each pair of headphones.  Also, shits expensive yo. 
c8cj1km	8	1	Yeah..  In the really nice theaters the bass physically shakes you, and that's pretty valuable to the experience.  Also the faked surround in most earbud type things is usually crap. 
c8cj8vq	4	0	You can create a dynamic bass environment, however, it takes a significant amount of sound engineering to have done. A basic setup to produce a normal amount of bass (radio DJs and the like) would require an amplifier or sound card with an amplifier, a direct connection from the movie or audio source as well as a pair of headphones that can match the audio quality of the amplifier and audio source. Now, you can get a movie experience through headphones (over the ear of course) for about $500 with Sennheiser (that's just the headphones).   I'm not a sound engineer, but the amount of money you would need to drop to have a $100 minimum amplifier for each audio source or even one amplifier for five seats (a standard amount of output jacks), you're looking at several thousand per auditorium minus the cost to have each one wired and minus the cost of the power supply that's going to be powering it all. Then you have to include the fact that you'll need to provide a basic number of headphones all of which are going to be $200 at a minimum to compete with the amplifiers output. That's $20,000 to provide headphones for 100 people. 
c8cjmo9	5	0	I was sort of assuming that in Mr Giblets suggestion, people would bring their own headsets, like on airplanes. So a standard 1/8th in jack.  Still, that's a detailed and thoughtful response, which I thank you for!  Extra credit for the ironic account name.

c8cdkp9	192	28	The most annoying ones are the idiots who text or FB during a movie.  "Oh I'm in a dark movie theater let me turn on a bright light!"  If you're that addicted to the net then rent the DVD and do it at home.
c8chqnv	17	1	Or do both, especially at cheaper matinee showings, who just talk and talk, out loud, no whispering, also the parents who bring their untrained colicky babies who are doubly scared by the things on screen... For fecks sake, get a babysitter or drop them off at your parents. 
c8ck3yo	17	0	I've never understood why people bring babies to the movies. They don't know what the fuck is going on, all they know is you're forcing them to sit in a dark room with a bunch of strangers while you ignore them in favor of watching a giant screen. Then they WILL start crying at some point, ruining the movie for everyone.   I PARTICULARLY don't get people who bring their babies to horror movies and wonder why they start howling like banshees when the scary music starts and the victims are screaming and shit...
c8ckfrv	8	0	Indeed, I used to work at a theatre in another lifetime, and I always faced issues with parents and scary pr movies rated above their kids ages. If I warned them ahead a time that the movie was a rating that their kids couldn't see alone, they'd complain about me telling them how to parent their kids. I got that response maybe 70% of the time and they were really upset about it. So I stopped warning them, however I'd then get the same parents for the most part come out after a little bit into the movie and tear into me for not telling them it had sex, scary stuff language or whatever in it...
c8ch9np	57	11	Watching The Dark Knight Rises. Final action sequence is getting rolling. Into the move. Disbelief suspentioned. Dickbag in the first row decides to hold his phone at eye level and check his email. Yanks me right out of the movie. Wanted to beat his ass. 
c8chdme	51	20	Where I live at, we'd do that. I usually go with a group of 4-5 people to the movies and whenever there are noisy kids or people talking on the phone we just tell them to shut the fuck up in the most intimidating way we can. Works every time.

c8ci6jf	7	0	I've told two or three people to leave the theater when they answered a phone call but I've spoken to or yelled at 6 or 7 for texting. My friends hate going to a movie with me. What is weird is I don't say shit to annoying people anywhere else. I get walked all over quite a bit. Don't fuck with my movies, though. 
c8ckvou	7	1	I worked at a movie theatre for like 5 years recently and one of the best perks of it all was being able to have any douchebag ruining the movie removed without really have any questions asked. You'd be amazed how quickly they shut the fuck up when you tell them you'll pull your super prestigious and not depressing movie theatre power card on them

Now a sniper facing out from above the screen with an IR scope and laser sighting would be a lot better. I might start going to the cinema again if that happened.

Not to pick on any one race, but I frequently see people of middle eastern descent just not give 1 single fuck in the movie theater. It isn't just a single group or few of them, every single one I have seen talk openly in the theater with the person they went with. I went to see Hansel and Gretel, entire family was there looked middle eastern (I can't say for sure, because I have no clue what they were speaking). Anyways, the entire movie dad was on the phone, actually took a fucking phone call during the movie was continuously opening and unlocking his phone. I told him to shut the fuck up several times after I had used simple shushing for the first 5-10 interruptions but nothing helped. His children were talking to each other the entire time laughing, shoutiing, etc.  Anyone from there know anything culturally where this is accepted there? I would really like to understand how you can thinking ruining a movie for someone is socially acceptable.
c8cn9n3	3	0	I rarely go to movies anymore because of the people who talk through the ENTIRE film. The last 3 times I have gone I had to leave and get an usher so I could enjoy my movie.  I have just started waiting until it becomes available on demand at home.   Back in the 90's, you were asked nicely to shut the fuck up and then asked to leave.   More of this shit needs to happen. I didn't pay $30.00 in tickets and pop corn to listen to someone talk during the movie.  I came to watch a god damn movie.  Leave your chit chat at the god damn door.

I doubt they would just come up and grab you though, the black costumes are part gimmick, part not disturbing other viewers, they probably just tap you on the shoulder and make the shhh sign.   Also for those saying its a lawsuit thing if your talking your probably not that engrossed in the film so some one coming up to you suddenly won't give you as much of a fright also your probably warned before hand.

c8cj8g8	1	0	What about seats with built in hydraulic systems? Someone is being too loud, send them flying through the roof.
c8cj907	2	0	Seems like it would encourage obnoxiousness in order to get the ninjas to shush them for comical reasons..or that's a totally biased 'merica way of thinking not sure
c8cj9c1	1	0	Can I volunteer for this position?
c8cjcsl	1	1	london, ontario?
c8cjdfd	1	0	[Russell Howard had this!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqU7koMtWw0)
c8cje8s	1	0	I love absinthe and Doritos
c8cjg71	1	0	After repeatedly having to get up and physically threaten people who thought they were anonymous in a dark theater, I just stopped going on weekend evenings. Unless I'm going to an art house theater, not so much scum there.
c8cjjed	1	0	And then obstruct the view of the people behind them. Or make the people scream, thus creating more (muffled) noise.
c8cjol6	1	0	fuck, more annoying is the camera guy/the flash he used
c8cjpqt	1	0	Anyone who's ever worn one of those suits knows it's impossible to see out of them even in daylight. I call shenanigans unless these ninjas stumble and fall towards every talker.
c8cjtkj	1	0	I can't even go to the movies anymore... how the fuck do people eat so loud.
c8cjuga	1	0	the irony that they are dressed in all black.
c8cjurk	1	0	I honestly think I would scream/pee my pants if one those things popped up near me in a theater.
c8cjw0u	1	0	This needs a "Brazzers" caption. 
c8cjyia	1	0	Shit, in parts of atlanta doing that kind of shit will get you shot
c8cjzi7	2	1	this is not fucking true i am sick of this shit 
c8ck23b	1	0	I saw Samsara, an entirely non-verbal movie, in the theaters and this giant white chick for some reason felt the need to sing along with this chant sung by a very deep voiced man in the middle of the movie. There were also two older folks who loudly, and almost entirely incorrectly, tried to guess every location shown in the film. I really like supporting weird and independent movies, but seriously, who freaking does that?!
c8ck2xt	1	0	I want that job!
c8ck2y8	1	0	So instead you have an asshole in a morph suit blocking your view? Doesn't seem much better to me.. 
c8ck8zw	1	0	I need this guy in my living room when I am trying to watch TV. My kids will not shut up for anything.
c8ckbib	1	0	Bully for them, then!
c8ckedp	1	0	Now we need a phone ninja to take peoples phones that apparently miss the 8 times they tell you to turn it off... Had some chick playing with her phone thru Identity Thief tonight about 5 rows down, my popcorn doesn't quite reach that far damnit!!
c8ckqy7	1	1	That'd be terrifying during a horror film at the most suspenseful part
c8cktb0	1	1	I'd scream if someone did that to me 
c8cktfn	2	0	honestly if some stranger cloaked in all black put a hand over my mouth at the movies I'd probably punch them in the face
c8ckxii	1	1	Why don't they just have headphone jacks, so if asshats are talking, you can just plug in your headphones that you brought and drown out the talkers?
c8cl1j4	1	0	Why would you want to watch movies with strangers anyway ?
c8cl1ts	1	0	I'd see this happening until someone takes the "ninja role" too seriously..
c8cl1y0	1	0	I worked at a Regal Cinema that had the ushers check on the show 3 times per showing and employed uniformed cops to stand by where the tickets are ripped. We got most of the city kids on weekend nights so it would get pretty loud at times. The look on every one of their faces when I threatened to kick them out was always the same. Some people just do not understand the concept that the you're supposed to shut up during movies.   Cell phones add a whole nother level of difficulty to the job. Some people just can't resist the urge to answer a text message. The tolerable customers would hide the phone under their coat or at least try to deflect the light but the ones who do it out in the open are inevitable. The best advice I can give for anyone going to see a movie, if you're unwilling to turn your phone off, before the movie just turn your phones brightness all the way down. It's beneficial to your eyes to not blind yourself looking at a bright phone in a dark room and the people around you most liekly won't be bothered.
c8cl50r	1	0	Ugh where were the ninjas when a pack of giggly girls were behind me?! 
c8cl5n5	1	0	this was posted before and i did a fix on it a while back in /r/ImGoingToHellForThis   [Every Movie Theater needs this.. [FIX]] (http://i.imgur.com/hjOb0.jpg)

c8cl7mp	1	0	They wear Yankees hats in London now?
c8cl9dp	1	0	I feel like people would go to theaters that have this to be annoying because they think it would be funny to have this done to them. Thus, creating more annoying movie goers.
c8cla8q	1	0	I was hoping it was Green Man - THUNDER GUN EXPRESS
c8clec5	1	0	I think I would pee my pants...
c8clez1	1	1	Unless you're seeing Cloud Atlas in the dollar theaters, with 80% of the theater population stoned. In that case commentary is welcome, and perhaps necessary
c8clg4f	1	0	I'm moving to London 
c8clgxu	1	0	Is anyone else worried about how they can actually shut people up without disrupting everyone else? I mean think about how narrow those rows are. They will trip down a row in front of everyone just to shut two preteen girls up, and then spill everyone's popcorn on the way out to boot.   Nice idea, but not realistic.
c8clgz0	1	0	This cinema is awesome, they have loads of marathon nights and show stuff like the Die Hard Trilogy, Alien trilogy, LOTR 1-3 all in one sitting.Best cinema ever!
c8clhmv	1	0	If they did this in the US, they would get their ass kicked alot
c8clkci	1	0	i'd dress as Slenderman and do it.
c8clltc	1	0	That's even more obnoxious and distracting for the viewers than someone talking because you are always watching for the "ninjas" (fuck them for using that name) and therefore aren't paying attention to the movie anyway.
c8clmhv	1	0	What's equally bad are the people that check their headlight-bright cell phone every 5 minutes throughout a movie.  Leave or watch the movie!
c8clmya	1	0	The PCC is currently doing 12 screenings of The Room- with a live intro from Tommy Wiseau &amp; Greg Sestero!   But I think its sold out
c8clwaf	1	0	been to this cinema and they do some awseome deals any one in and around london should go there. not for the ninjas but for the the movies they show.
c8cly96	1	0	*cough* black people *cough*
c8cm10o	1	0	anyone else weirded out by the image of a black man forcibly covering the mouths of young blonde teens to keep them quiet?
c8cm1jj	1	0	Assault charges and a lawsuit waiting to happen
c8cm29o	1	1	No days in the theater I see this as a good way to get shot. At least where I'm from almost everyone around Texas started caring there pistols fucking everywhere. I try to keep mine in my truck.
c8cm40s	2	0	This seems like it would just make assholes get angry and obnoxious, and get douches to make noise on purpose so they can be shushed my the ninjas.
c8cm4f8	1	0	Could have used this when I went to see bullet to the head as there was some polish kids up the back talking loudly as well as some black kids right behind me falling right into their stereotype.
c8cm4m8	1	0	Count me in XD
c8cm649	1	0	"More Jobs for black people" hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
c8cm6aj	1	0	Someone does that to me, I will go for their eyes.   Rational? Probably not. I just know myself. 
c8cm6ej	1	0	will they break their phones as well?
c8cm6g6	1	0	Heeey, the Prince Charles! I'm a proud lifetime member. There's more to this cinema than ninjas.
c8cmamx	1	0	SERIOUSLY?? SERIOUSLY IM STILL FUCKING SEEING THIS?? THAT IS ACTUALLY UNBELIEVABLE
c8cmc1h	1	0	Ha, I go here about once a month, never even seen these guys. They're either really good ninja's, or just don't exist. To be fair, I've never been annoyed by an obnoxious movie-goer...
c8cmdgi	1	1	I feel like I'm the only one who has NEVER gone to a movie where people talked during it.
c8cmfuc	1	0	Bleached blonde hair, about 14 years old, and yankees hat cocked to th side... Yep, burn him.
c8cmkcb	1	1	Living in the inner city...  They would be killed... But they are DEFINATELY needed!  
c8cmoqv	1	0	Based on my experience with vulgar british tourists, I believe they're called chavs. Not the ninjas, the assholes who're assholes.
c8cmr7o	1	0	Hey, isn't that the cinema behind Leicester Square? The one that shows dated movies but for really cheap tickets?
c8cv4gv	3	0	Well here is a tip my friend. This, for example, is a reaction gif. Try /r/reactiongifs?  Get outside of the huge defaults. Stay involved in the comments. Have fun, don't worry about the 'score'.

c8cexcr	152	16	well in his defense, you do have a pink shirt on... 
c8cf5c7	189	44	It's salmon. Don't confuse the two.
c8cfsqd	64	17	I know right. probably wouldn't be able to tell chartreuse apart from fuchsia. there's just no hope for some people
c8chtht	33	8	Well chartreuse is greenish and fuschia is pinkish, so... I'm guessing it's not that hard.

c8chtoh	44	7	[Chartreuse](http://imgur.com/1no22Ws) and [Fuschia](http://i.imgur.com/3qUr7aj.jpg) look nothing alike.  You're making fun of color blindness, not bad taste.

c8cko8p	2	1	Do I have to be the one to say this? Based on the reflection from the balloon... I bet this redditor is lying and the balloon was given to him/her by friends

c8ciwwe	1	0	I did something like this on Mother's Day. Needed some balloons, all I could find were black balloons with white lettering that read "Happy Birthday!" So I took a sharpie and blacked out Birth on all the balloons.
c8cj8s8	2	0	So, what's the actual story behind this anyways?   EDIT: Why did Connor want a "Prince" balloon?   Why is everyone wearing light shades of red?   These are the tough questions.
c8cjam6	1	0	One Christmas, my grandpa gave me the following:  -Personalized handkerchiefs; the ones with the first letter of your name on them in the corner.

c8cg1b3	7	7	While I support everyone's right to celebrate, [I just want to point out that their is a global helium shortage!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-epAQQ75ZE)  If you're going to buy party balloons please make sure you go somewhere that fills them with a more abundant gas, they may not float but if you put them on a stick (like the one in the picture seems to be) then they are great for children's birthday parties. Scientists everywhere will thank you!
c8cid3b	2	1	I work at a Dollar Tree, every single time I inflate a balloon I feel like I am wasting a precious resource.
c8cjmiq	2	0	Stinkstiefel.
c8cmutk	1	0	Isn't this what economics is for?  As helium becomes more and more scarce, the price will go up and the group that needs it most will get it?  Moral suasion doesn't work.
c8cvco0	1	0	I don't think that will work in this case, funding for science is stretched to its limit. If you start to increase operating costs because the price of Helium goes up you need to get that money from a politician. That and we don't want to make it more scarce to start with, there is currently a very limited supply and no one can cheaply create the molecules of Helium, yet.  Where economics would come in handy is forcing scientists to find a way to use other forms of gas to achieve the same cooling levels, or as I said above, create the molecules in a cheap sustainable way. Regardless I'm just informing those who aren't aware, not trying to create a debate on the topic.

c8cjgao	9	1	I don't know about the picture but I am in Northern California and it is always sunny and mild. It sucks. The few times it rains are a blessing. 
c8cjlzs	1	0	It sucks? I live in NC, so our weather is pretty fucking great compared to most places(no real extremes, other than the occasional hurricane)., but we do to get more rain and humidity than I'd like. Sunny and mild without an overabundance of rain sounds nice.  Edit: By too much rain I mean in the fall/winter. Bring on the rain on a hot day. Much better than drowning in sweat because the humidity feels like 100%.

Give me blizzard, give me drought, **I dont care** just please take the fucking gray away.
c8clucc	2	0	I'm from the Mojave Desert. I'll trade with you. Year-round chapped lips for your wonderful-smelling rain. Blinding blue skies get incredibly boring day after day, and I can't go outside without scrunching my face up in a squint. This place literally gives me cancer.
c8clwku	1	0	You dont understand. The dark makes me depressed. I'm not a depressive person normally, but on a dark day I might as well be. I am sad, day after day, not for "no reason", but just because it's dark. I'd trade in a second if my life wasn't here. Use a fucking chapstick. Whatever.

c8cpnhj	1	0	Well I don't know that you're missing it, but I've heard only good things about the weather in BC. And I believe you have some pretty epic mountains if you head north, there's your snow.
c8cpwnc	1	0	I personally do prefer warmer weather, but lots of snow once in a while is nice! And yes we do have mountains, ski hills and other sources of snow, where I live it is quite a drive to get anywhere!

c8cqne9	2	0	Yeah never mention it again if you know what's good for you! I stupidly tried to use reddit for educational purposes and all it got me was 3 hours of erasing stuff... a lot of stuff.

c8crbdn	2	0	Yeah I have alternate accounts I just was asking some subreddits some questions for a school activity not expecting to get anything useful so I used my main username.

c8ccbuy	74	12	this guy is a great author. check out "childhood's end" for a great read.
c8cfulm	31	2	I really enjoyed the Rama series, too.
c8cg1rf	8	0	How do the sequels compare to the first? From a superficial Wikipedia research they sounded so far off from the original that I never bothered buying them but now I'm out of stuff to read.
c8cg4wr	8	0	Totally different storyline, like 2-4 could be independent.  But an excellent read and one of my fav sci-fi stories.  You get drawn into the characters, explore the ship, learn the history and background, and then it all gets wrapped up in the end.  Edit: Wow, just read that apparently for 2-4 Gentry Lee did all the writing and Clark only threw out occasional ideas. So I guess they're not really Clark books.
c8clxfs	1	0	Also one of my favourites. 2 does take a while to get going but it does a decent job of introducing the characters and setting up the scenario. I can see why it may put people off though.

c8cji8e	1	0	Thank you, sir.
c8cgpzd	7	0	Read them all, but I really did not like them (the sequels) very much.  I think ACC really just gave story ideas to Gentry Lee...the books aren't really written in the style of Clarke.  The first Rama stand fine on its own.  There's plenty of other great Clarke stuff to read if you want to.
c8cg64j	1	0	I remember liking them, but not much beyond that.  It's probably been eight or nine years since I've read them.
c8cg92o	2	0	2010 was good. The one after that less so.
c8ch73h	2	0	I really enjoyed the first one, but tbh just couldnt get into the second. It seemed more focused on the mundane shit, and not really getting to the whole "youre on a fucking alien spaceship, what you gonna do?". 
c8cjs23	2	0	They were exploring the thing. I read the whole series to find out what the ship was supposed to be.
c8cmdxg	2	0	Personally I am totally happy with the first and don't plan to read the rest. I love that he specifically left it open ended, without fully explaining. I could feel the same frustration that the crew felt, never fully knowing what Rama is or why it was created. 
c8chsh8	2	0	I wish that fucking Rama movie would get out of development hell already.
c8clxox	1	0	Apparently they are still waiting for a script they really like. There won't be much acting left in Morgan Freeman if they take too much longer.
c8cgcos	12	3	Here's another great one. Really hit me hard when i was a kid http://downlode.org/Etext/nine_billion_names_of_god.html
c8cgkvw	3	0	I've always liked "Rescue Party".  This may be the closest Sir Arthur came to a fun space adventure, while still retaining his trademark ideas of very non-human alien species and some philosophical issues.  http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/random042/98096307.html
c8cgqbf	1	0	This is one of my favorite ACC short stores as well!
c8chwj9	4	1	Yes. That one and "[The Star](http://web.archive.org/web/20080718084442/http://lucis.net/stuff/clarke/star_clarke.html)" are my favorite works of his. It's probably messed up that I read "The Star" every Christmas, but oh well...
c8cq8y2	1	0	That story cost me $40. I read it on his shirt stories anthology and immediately bought the book.
c8cf1x7	6	2	Childhoods end was one of the few books I had to read in school that I actually enjoyed. Great book!
c8cgt71	3	0	Go back and reread some of those old high school books. Every five years or so, you're a different enough person that you'll get something else out of it.   I hated Catcher in the Rye when I first read it but loved it the second time 10 years later. 
c8cgdbl	1	0	The chapter with the island rising up to meet the dawn was extremely sad. Great writing.
c8ch8e7	3	0	You may also be surprised to learn about a little-known Physicist by the name of Albert Einstein.  In other news, [geostationary satellites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit) might be a good idea. [You know — for](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng3XHPdexNM) communications. 
c8ck4y8	1	0	Islands in the Sky too!
c8crhx5	1	0	He is also the first person to postulate the use of satellites for communication!  Do you have a high maintenance engine? If you drive a foreign brand car you probably do! (except Toyota) http://iamgermane.blogspot.com/2011/12/do-you-have-high-maintenance.html
c8cgdwu	19	0	How come such great scientist as you believes in a horse shoe nailed above the entrance?  I do not believe in it, but they say that it helps even people who don't believe in it.  Niels Bohr  PS. This is reverse translation of the meaning from Russian
c8clgtx	2	0	But Bohr was Danish...
c8cm0w9	3	0	There was another joke about Bohr. His first lecture in English was so bad, one attendant asked him if what language he was speaking. He replied: "Danish, of course".   "Then why did you put so many English words in it?"   
c8cmdc1	3	0	From what Danish I've encountered, it does come across as a bastard of English and German.
c8cmeh2	3	0	Most disturbing part of Danish is that it sounds like the speaker is chewing all the time.
c8cg6n7	17	1	How many copies of 2001 &amp; 2010 does he need on his book shelves?
c8cgkc0	21	3	One of each edition. When he dies his family can use the collection as a form of insurance. They're all probably signed too. All the Apollo astronauts did something similar with their photos. 
c8cgqlp	14	0	He died several years ago.
c8cgs2r	12	0	He also had no family
c8chyqx	5	0	No *surviving* family, that is.
c8ci4ml	4	0	No wife or children. It was a moderately open secret that he was gay, and I seem to recall he had a longtime "companion", while living in Sri Lanka.
c8cilq9	5	0	His companion also had a wife and family, who strong-armed him into signing the contents of his will over while he was dying.   Source: father is a long-time friend.
c8cje3m	4	1	Clarke was the gay one, but Asimov died of AIDS. /r/mildlyinteresting 
c8clgny	3	0	Contracted HIV during a heart bypass. Damn.
c8clm9o	2	0	I'm pretty sure he included his companion in one of his books, The Fountains of Paradise.
c8ck4zr	2	0	He sorta had an adopted family in Sri Lanka, apparently.
c8cgszd	3	1	I failed to remember that. Damn shame. Regardless, point stands: one of every edition, most likely signed. Every edition of 2001, signed by Clarke, would be a nice little bit of cash. 
c8ch697	4	0	I somehow doubt that was his motive. 
c8cglb7	2	0	They are probably all translations...
c8ch6zp	10	2	I really don't remember saying this.
c8cnxbc	1	0	&gt;I never said most of the things I said.  ~Yogi Berra
c8cheft	5	0	It is bad luck to be superstitious.
c8cgrhj	8	1	He looks EXACTLY like S.R. Hadden (John Hurt) from Contact. 
c8ch8wq	8	0	No...S.R. Hadden looks like HIM. 
c8chb6v	2	0	True.
c8cl16o	1	0	strangely, he looks more like Hari Seldon (Asimov's Foundation) to me.
c8cs24j	1	0	Came here to see if anyone else thought of this. I've never read his books, but now I will in Hadden's voice... "Wanna go for a ride?" 
c8chvbd	5	0	I'm a Sagittarius too! I BELIEVE!
c8cioi9	5	0	At first I was glad that a fellow sagittarian proved that we are not all skeptics, but then I saw your username. 
c8cgjdh	7	1	That fucking jacket was probably given to him *by* Nehru.
c8cgahj	7	2	Is it just me, or does he look like Davros?
c8chcxe	5	2	Arthur C Clarke has the weirdest boner in this pic
c8chjeu	1	1	Thank you, I'm glad I'm not the only one that noticed he's packing.
c8ciloi	1	1	He is wearing a sarong -- basically a big sheet that has been stitched at the edges. To keep it up, you have to tie a knot, and generally people tie that knot symmetrically.  So I am guessing it was not a boner! 
c8cir5t	1	2	Did you seriously think I thought it was?
c8chpik	4	0	*Fountains of Paradise*, a novel about the creation of a space elevator, in part to pursue a Martian terraforming project.  It's technically accurate, except the material with that strength-to-weight ratio is currently "unobtainium".  He added a fictional equatorial island with a very tall mountain peak as the only place initially practical to anchor the elevator.  However, being the tallest peak, it's also got a monastery and the site is of great historical value- yet it's the only site which could by used.    The flip is that the builders are still basically protagonists who have to do questionable things to make the progress happen, as opposed to the standard plot which would always have anyone doing that be the evil overlord antagonist who gloats gleefully when a monastery is crushed.  They're not happy about it, but see a greater good as making it necessary for mankind.  
c8clf2c	2	0	It also predicts what are basically RSS news feeds on the internet (book is from 1979), it has software agents that scan a global  communications network for news you are interested in.

c8ckld0	1	0	He looks like [Davros](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00683/dr-who-davros-404_683793c.jpg) from DW.
c8clnw6	2	0	Unrelated, but I thought I'd share. Several weeks ago I noticed that someone had printed out obituaries about Arthur Clarke and put them around the city I live in. They were clearly fan-made and were very touching.   Also, apparently some people disliked the idea for some reason because I noticed some of them disappearing.. Which is kinda sad.
c8clwr4	1	0	Arthur C. Clarke was the Six Flags Dancing Grandpa.
c8cmlcl	1	0	I'm pretty sure he's [this guy](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Hd4PNP31TxI/R0OKZDk4d2I/AAAAAAAAALU/oARV001zTYQ/s1600/dr.evil)

c8cw6k0	1	0	Bla bla bla, typical sagittarius.
c8cgyy4	4	1	In my office all the girls believe that astrology is indeed very real.   * "Oh you wouldn't go well with her, you're a Pisces"   * "Of course you're easily irritated, that's such a Gemini thing!"  * "I'm sure you will do well, Libras are naturally confident"  They are welcome to believe in anything they want and I will never tell them my opinion (that it is all bullshit), but man does it get irritating hearing that EVERYTHING happens since you're that specific zodiac sign.   In before "This is exactly what a _________ would say" 
c8chu95	6	0	ask them all if they've had their entire chart mapped.. i bet that they only know their sun sign (the one everyone knows), and dont know much about it otherwise.   just because you are one sun sign, the rest of a persons signs (moon, rising and about 12 or so others) can be different enough to make you not seem like that sign at all..  not saying i believe in astrology, but i've looked into it enough to know that people who believe the things in your bullet points really don't know much. 
c8ckq6v	3	0	&gt;They are welcome to believe in anything they want and I will never tell them my opinion (that it is all bullshit), but man does it get irritating hearing that EVERYTHING happens since you're that specific zodiac sign.  This is exactly what a someone who is tired of listening to other peoples stupid bullshit would say
c8cisph	1	0	This conversation came up at work too. I thought he (yeah it was a *straight* guy, not a girl spouting that bull) was a smart person. Guess not. 
c8chz4i	3	2	Wasn't there a rumour that Arthur C Clarke  was diddling little kids in Sri Lanka? Was it ever proved?
c8cmet5	1	0	I have heard it, but found no evidence when I investigated. He was gay though, and at that time in England we were not very forward thinking. He moved to Sri Lanka in 1956. Consider that "Alan Turing's homosexuality resulted in a criminal prosecution in 1952, when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United Kingdom." You can see why he might want to GTFO. 
c8ch7ir	3	1	My favorite human being ever.
c8chcp9	5	5	I hate to break the news to you, but people are flawed.  With some having more flaws than others.  In that regard, Arthur C. Clarke was indeed human.  Aspects of his personal life may get you to reconsider your affection for him.  I'm not going to say what it was, but I suggest that you look it up.
c8ci0jv	8	0	If you're talking about the pedophilia charges, they were dismissed after being found to be groundless.  If you're talking about the fact that he liked dudes, then that would make you a jerk.
c8cive7	3	2	Sure and he didn't say this...  "I am trying to think of the youngest boy I have ever had because, of course, you can't tell it here (Sri Lanka). I think most of the damage comes from the fuss made by hysterical parents afterwards. If the kids don't mind, fair enough."
c8cskre	1	0	Can I get a source?
c8chi1e	2	1	Does. He. Have. A. Boner?
c8ci3bh	2	1	He looks exactly like my image for Hari Seldon in Asimov's Foundation books.
c8cijt2	2	1	Modern astrology is actually "off". In astrology what defines your "sign" is which of the 13 constellation of The Zodiac was most predominant when you were born. The "calendar" that modern astrologists use is the same one used 2000 years ago.  However due to precession, the axis that the Earth rotates around is slowly rotating itself, so over time the poles of the Earth are pointing to a different part of space. As a result of this, over the years The Zodiac is aligned differently and therefore a constellation is prominent during a different time period.  Today the time periods of a particular sign are off by about 24 days, for example if you're born on May 4th you're considered a Taurus when actually you were born under the constellation of Aries.
c8cipua	3	0	Considering that astrology is about as accurate as the magic of a four-leaf clover or rabbit's feet, I don't think it really matters. I'm born Sagittarius, but I think for tomorrow I want to be Cancer, just because. 
c8ctwzo	1	0	I don't believe in it either, but I didn't post this information to call anyone who does believe in it an idiot.
c8cjieo	1	1	Constellation, not consolation.  . . . I don't know what it says about my overexposure to meaningless hippie bullshit that the *wording* is what my brain first flagged as wrong out of all that.
c8ctvl4	1	0	Fixed it, auto correct sucks. Thanks for bringing it to my attention, and thanks for being a dick about it too 
c8cikw8	1	2	I'm Sagittarius and all it means is that I was born between November 22nd and December 21st and I'm represented by a centaur archer. There is no such thing as magical personality attributes based on the month you were born in.   Edit: I am not a smart person. I sought out to put forth my opinion that being sagittarius does not mean we are skeptical, but I came out sounding skeptical. I need a fellow sagittarian to come save me and say something non-skeptical.

c8ce3wb	19	4	Ok, writing here will put a swear word on my post but this has to be said.   Suppose she didnt have as many colors as him?

c8cfciq	15	1	I disagree on both counts; the raw energy she projects in her work, however, conveys far more evocative expressions than his superior technique.
c8ce2vt	131	12	in a way, that in itself could be construed as a message. The second painting, being one that was done to not just copy but outdo, has a calm and ordered chaos- one born of many years of practice. The second painter's lines have a feeling they are but a copy of the first, the message coming across as a comparative study between how age and experience lessons the raw emotions of children, but also how order and rhythm is gained from a detachment from these raw emotions.  The message I get from this piece, foremost, is a message that the second artist longs to be a child and to be in his boss's mind foremost, but understands this is impossible due to how his world has shaped him- and at most, he can only mimic or mirror what he wishes to be. 
c8cfm41	23	1	This is almost BSed as well as any description of Modern Art I've ever seen.

My mom held out on my becoming a lawyer for a good six years after I dropped the whole surgeon thing, though, haha.

c8cf87f	7	0	I remember the shock I had when my uncle first pointed out that I coloured outside the lines in my colouring book. No one had ever critiqued my art before. Though my three year old self was offended at the time, it may have given me a meticulous competitive edge that led to my growth as an artist.

c8ceet2	26	2	When I was about 13-14 and the the younger kids in the family were getting to the age of coloring and getting their pictures on the fridge... I got a bit jealous.   So I took one of their coloring books, and colored my own picture and hung it on the fridge. Turned out I had a pretty good time coloring, so I colored several more. Coloring is a lot of fun.   Ended up having about 15-16 pictures hanging on the fridge. Mom just shook her head and smiled, she left them up for about a week or so. She was pretty cool about it considering you could barely see anything else on the fridge with all my pictures.   I ended up buying my own coloring book eventually and still to this day I occasionally color in kids coloring books while watching TV or something. And I hang them on my own fridge now :D

You've done far worse stuff than this and gotten away with it. right? Wrong.   I think you've just signed your resignation there Justin 23. Your Boss brought a shitty drawing his Daughter made for him to work to brighten up his day. You know what you did, you officially mocked his Daughters shitty drawing for the entire office. Hell, you even signed It.

I mean sure, I might be a little taken aback if that was my kid's picture, but, it's not the end of the world and I wouldn't make a scene. I understand some people might not dig that whole thing.

Yet I can't look away. He transcends time and space. He sickens me. I love it.

My stomach will hurt so badly and I'll feel like a fucking balloon, but then when I finally get a chance to get to the bathroom nothing comes out. Then right as I walk back I find myself clenching my sphincter muscle rhythmically and sweating like a pig trying to hold back the demon in my ass.
c8cjeuf	44	7	But god damn... some of the most orgasmic, full-bodied, voluminous ass-rips have happened in the car on the way home from dropping off the girl. Fuck me. I moan in relief. It's like the virgin-use of a fire extinguisher -- raw pressure. Divine.
c8cg0x2	53	5	This. I hate when you go to the bathroom to do your thing, sit down or whatever and it just won't come. Then, you admit defeat, get up and walk back. Of course on your way back you'll feel twice as shitty and can't go back because a) you've already been gone for awhile or 2) you'll look like an idiot going back to the bathroom 
c8ck484	22	2	The bathroom trip is pretty much a one time thing. Use it wisely.

c8ccvhe	389	48	Here's what you do: Tell her you need to fart and you know that she needs to as well, then go somewhere where it's more appropriate and fart together. That way, when she tries to dump you, you say, "but we shared so many intimate moments... like that time we farted together in the kitchen pantry..." She'll realize her mistake and get back together with you :)

c8cfc2t	28	5	People on Reddit, generally, find farting completely fine and encourage it to break the norm of it being considered gross. Some jokes will follow something along the lines of "if the person you are on a date with farts in front of you, you should marry her/him" or "if you haven't heard their butt whistle after the first few dates you should drop them."  I don't think one should feel ashamed if it happens, but you cannot deny that the odor it produces is less than pleasant. It's still best to be avoided (in my opinion of course).
c8cfxd2	41	3	I farted while reading this comment.
c8cfdf7	9	3	I was unaware. I agree, its not some sort of taboo, its just how our bodies work, but if you could help it, please don't fart in my vicinity, also I understand accidents happen. 
c8cfd4h	17	1	A lot of people make the argument that everyone farts, so why isn't is socially acceptable to do so in public. Well, if I smell that fart, I'm smelling a spray of your butt junk, so I'd rather not.

c8cfnxz	6	0	true man, don't explode over something as trivial as a fart, but if you are around some people, especially in a more closed environment, excuse yourself for a bit, go to the bathroom, and rip ass with pride. It is a bathroom after all.

c8ced1x	127	13	FO' REEL.  Last night, I was actually in pain from the gas build up by the end.  While I didn't want the date to be over because things were going so great, the relief I felt when I got in my car and let out, really, the hugest fart I've ever experienced was...significant.  Just...I can't think of a word for it.  It was wasn't even a fart in the FFFFRRRRAPPPP! way, but just a huge exhalation of gas.  HUGE.  And it didn't stink, which was probably a good thing because I can't even imagine.
c8cem3d	93	13	1) Go to the bathroom  2) Fart  3) Stand there for a few minutes, so that the smell doesn't follow you back to your table  4) Return to table, resume date
c8cf4h9	45	0	OR you could just ESCAPE your FART.   http://www.snotr.com/video/110/How_To_Escape_A_Fart  
c8cgjjp	18	0	Oh perfect I can just inhale the entire volume of my fart.
c8cfkl8	21	2	The worst part is going to the bathroom for this very reason, the need to fart dissipating when you get there, only to return when you sit back down.
c8cfm51	8	0	Yep, I hate that.
c8cemh9	24	3	Well, the date mostly consisted of sexy times.  Couldn't go anywhere.  Edit:  The "date" consisted of me meeting someone from online for sexy times.
c8ceno3	14	0	Oh. Well at that point I usually just let 'er rip. If they're willing to fuck you, then they're probably not going to dump you over a fart. (Just try to wait until the physical act of sex is over, first.)
c8ch2yk	21	3	One time I was holding in farts during sex (not ruin the mood and whatnot), but when I started to cum I couldn't hold it in any longer.  With each finishing thrust and ejaculate expulsion, I released the foul, venomous gas from my brown eye.  She's moaning with pleasure; I'm laughing hysterically and announce during the last few thrusts that I'm farting.  The smell permeates throughout the room, she tries to squirm away, but I'm still orgasming and farting in synchronization, and so as to not make a mess, she gives up hope and submits, as the smell of fart, cum, and shame fills up the room.
c8cewmk	5	1	easier said than done
c8cf0qm	10	10	But it's so much fun to watch them squirm when you rip one and you pull a dutch oven while receiving a blowie. 
c8cfgbi	17	2	Was the venue your or her place? If so, you can still excuse yourself to the bathroom.  I tried that once but the farts kept leaving as soon as stood up to go to the bathroom only to return when i was sitting again next to her. After a few times excusing myself to go to bathroom to unsuccessfully fart, i decided i'd simulate the sitting position clothed on the sink to try to induce fart labor. Instead i nearly shat myself.

c8cfisv	3	0	Hotel room.  Bathroom was right there and it woulda echoed sum'n fierce.  Edit:  Gosh darnit.  Don't you hate when you re-read a comment a couple of times to make sure there are no mistakes and STILL miss them?
c8cg4bi	7	0	The trick is to tell her that you've all of the sudden come up with the genius idea of going to the ice machine to get a pail full for enhancing your sexual experience. She'll jump at the opportunity (mostly because it means that she'll have a few free moments to simultaneously blast ass in the washroom while you're out) and you get the bonus of putting ice cubes in her butt upon your return.  Secondary Objective: After retrieving your ice, fart directly into the ice bin so that the next time it's opened, the user receives an Arctic cloud of ass air right in the face. Hilarious.

c8cfdg4	60	6	I made a girl laugh so hard that she farted on a date. She looked mortified, but i just laughed and then let out the fart i was holding. I was so happy she did that. 
c8cjovu	16	1	college days. girl stayed the night. i had to work early and let her sleep in. i forgot something in my room and as i was about to turn the doorknob i heard the loudest, longest, 3 farts in a row in my entire life. i opened the door and the look on her face...i was i had a camera..
c8cl2w6	13	1	I was you had a camera too.
c8cg0ha	54	1	This is why guys open the door for women. Once she gets in the car and the door is closed, it's fart city all the way from the passenger side to the drivers door.
c8cdycu	27	3	For some reason my noisy stomach always makes girls laugh and has lead to some good times.
c8cf842	15	1	My stomach does that too. Almost as if it's sucking the fart back in. 
c8cemfk	50	9	My farts are chock full of pheromones.  It's like a love potion.  I spray that shit everywhere and the ladies go wild.    Pro Tip: Aim for the face.

c8cemsz	29	0	And that's when you knew it was true love.
c8ceo4x	16	1	Yep. Been together 6 years in june
c8cf4ei	40	9	Then why did you refer to him as your fiance? He isn't now and he wasn't in your story.....?      edit: because you're still not married.  I should be a detective.

c8cfke4	11	0	Dude...
c8cghuo	7	0	He is my fiancé now. We have been engaged for 2 years now but havent been able to get married yet.   You wouldnt make a very good detective without getting all the facts of the story first.
c8cfi6i	54	3	Oh gawd this reminds me. Date no. 3 with a girl I was getting pretty comfortable with. We were watching a movie and having a chat when my bowels were slowly letting me know that they intended to fuck with me on my date.  I kept holding and holding and sometimes you would hear my bowels really growl and churn, to which I responded with a semi-funny reaction to make it less awkward. I could barely hold it and it started to feel real bad. I excused myself to go to the toilet and from the moment of standing up to full standing position I farted. I was like the farts lifted me to a standing position. Also it was probably loud enough to wake up people 2 blocks away... Instead of instantly making a witty comment I just stood there, looked at the girl and she was frozen in shock. Good thing I remembered that I think farts are the funniest things ever and started to laugh hysterically all the way to the bathroom where I continued my ass-symphony coupled with laughter. 
c8cg9ae	16	4	OMG i was laughing so hard reading this. You get all my Karma! 
c8cfmq0	30	1	ITT: people with lactose intolerance who don't know it.
c8cfo2z	16	2	Every *person on a first date.
c8cerv1	13	0	Going to the bathroom works unless you need to fart every few minutes. Then it's kind of hard to use the bathroom as your farting place.
c8cfpnz	23	1	Start coughing and clapping your hands so that she won't hear your farts.
c8cfo1z	5	1	Seriously why does this not occur to people.  Excuse yourself and let loose in the bathroom if you're really embarrassed about your natural bodily functions.
c8cfs3m	49	9	I went on a first "date" once (I picked up this dude from a bar, plied him with alcohol, and dragged him home), where he farted the entire way back to my house.  He'd always fart loudly, giggle like a child, and then say "Ooo!  Did you hear that peep toad?" or "Whoa! [animated motion] There's a barking spider around here!"    At this point, I was in too deep, he was cute, we were both drunk, and I wanted to get laid.  So, we go inside, have some great sex, and all is well with the world.  Of course, he didn't stop farting and blaming it on mythological creatures.  Whatever, farting's natural, and he was good in bed, so I can put up with it.  A few days later, I invite him over again for some good ol' fashioned sex.  We bang, and fall asleep. I'm dead asleep, when I'm awoken by an incredibly foul odor.  I realize this gorgeous man has either died and shit himself, or **he farted and it smelled so badly it woke me up.**  I tried not to breathe, (or gag) and eventually fell back asleep.    I kept seeing him, and he turned out to be a pretty cool dude.  We're married now, and we fart on each other all the time.  So yeah, farting's not a total deal breaker.  
c8cefyl	23	1	Correction: Every guy on the first 20 dates. Possibly until marriage.
c8cekvy	11	0	Wishful thinking ma'am. I'm not gonna fuck up my stomach to protect you from bodily functions.
c8ce5ss	9	0	I say live and let it rip!
c8cfl9r	11	2	First date? I still do this after 6 years of marriage! We were out with friends tonight, I let a small one go not knowing how bad it actually was. One lady sitting two seats over accused her own husband abruptly scolding him... Apart from the bright redness in my face and my wife's giggling, I would have gotten away with it.  It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from, a well timed fart is ALWAYS funny
c8cfsh3	8	0	Can someone tell me how he's able to hold that spikey fish? It's not venomous?  Poisonous? Toxic?
c8cf6om	15	2	I got into a fight with a girl at her house just so I could leave and fart. She had a small house one bathroom no exhaust fan.
c8cfdcx	19	1	I was sitting in my car with my ex back when we were super in love with each other. I needed to fart so bad after a 4 hour date and she kept on talking before getting out of the car. I decided to start a fight to get her to leave. Worst idea ever. We ended up sitting there for at least 20 more minutes. And I always wait until a girl gets into her house before driving away. Bitch couldn't find her keys. Finally when she got in I turned my car on started driving, pulled over for safety, turned off the music because I wanted to hear that devil.   It took me like 3 minutes to get it all out but felt so amazing. Smelled horrible. I still smelt it 3 hours later in my car.
c8celh1	17	3	1. Go to bathroom. 2. Fart. 3. Congratulations, problem solved.

c8cf9gg	12	1	Last weekend I was on a first date, lying on the bluffs near torey pines golf course, drinking wine. Surpised she trusted me out there.. .but anyways, I rolled over on the blanket to fill up my glass and the loudest fart erupted. I could feel it rumble underneath me into the hard packed dirt, she must have felt it.   I obviously tried covering it up with moving around more loudly and clearing my throat. But then realized it really didn't matter.   tl;dr: farted loudly on first date.

c8cfdz1	19	1	Honestly, If a guy was on a date with me and he was dying then I'd want him to tell me. I know how much it can suck and if he absolutely needs to then I wouldn't really care.  But if you're just dropping a bunch of unannounced farts out of no where all the time on a first date I might have a problem with that. 
c8cffaf	22	1	If you ask me girls on Reddit tend to be more understanding than the general population.
c8cfi3z	12	0	So announced farts are OK? *makes note in black book*

c8cfca9	24	1	I am a guy who farts consistently. I'm just saying if every girl was thinking "I wish people would just fart." the social stigma wouldn't exist.
c8cfhiq	19	3	My boyfriend was a lot more modest about farting than me. That changed pretty rapidly after the first few Dutch ovens.
c8cf5lu	68	4	HEY. GIRLS. **PLEASE FART**. Then we can fart too, and stop all this suffering and madness.  We usually see you as the more polite/manner-minding person at the date. So we're waiting on you.  Sincerely, *some guys*.

c8cfir7	6	0	Hey guise. I need advice. When my boyfriend and I hang out, at his place or mine, I can't bring myself to fart or poop. Neither does he. Last time I visited him, I finally pooped and it hurt so bad I felt extremely sick. He had pooped, too. How do we get over the embarrassment? I have to visit him again soon and I don't want to hold it for four days :,(

c8cf9kk	5	0	It's the worst thing when you finally let it out and it's just gas with no smell or sound. makes me so angry.
c8cfct0	5	0	When it's my first time with the lady in bed... I usually sneak off to the bathroom 3-4 times throughout the night.  Squeeze out that flatulent goodness (because you know it's about 2 or 3 compressed farts) while the faucet is running.  I get zero sleep, but don't matter - had sex.  She either thinks I have a small bladder, thirsty for some tap water, or... maybe she is on to me (and appreciates the non-dutch oven morning wake up).  Either way, it's better than letting her smell and hear what she's going to have to deal with in the coming weeks... If you make it that far.
c8cgtdm	5	0	My dad had a car in the 50's that had fins, a Chevy or something. It had pictures of Pepe' Le pew painted on it. My mother said they were on their first date, he roared around a corner, and my mother ripped the noisiest fart due to her fear. They were married 54 years before my dad passed. Ladies fart, guys love it!

c8cfftf	4	0	Being on dates and chewing gum go hand in hand, and I assure you that while chewing gum you'll be swallowing lots of air. That's the recipe for loads of gas exiting both ends. 
c8cgn77	4	0	When I was in high school, I had to pass gas an entire car ride home. When we finally got to her place, she decided she wanted to stay in the car and talk. We talked for 3 hours. My stomach was going crazy and even though I was having a good time, I desperately needed to leave. I went to kiss her goodnight before she got out of the car and suddenly she climbed on top of me. I thought I was going to pass gas right then. I was nervous, sweaty, and shaking. She probably thought I was nervous about kissing her. Little did she know, I was about to explode. And not the way she expected.  Fifteen minutes later, I walked her to the door with my stomach rumbling like mad, got in my car, shit myself, and drove home. 
c8cf77v	9	4	I went on a day long date with my GF a few weeks ago. Part way through the day I developed a case of explosive diarrhea!  I didn't want to tell her so I slipped into the bathroom at Starbucks and blew it up. Later that evening she decided to go see The Hobbit. I had to endure the entire movie. It was the worst date ever.
c8cfrw4	16	2	Wait. Your relationship is advanced enough for you to call her your girlfriend, but you didn't feel comfortable telling her you had a serious health problem and needed to end the date early because of it? Dude, I'm almost sure anyone would have been fine with it, but you definitely didn't need to be nervous about telling your girlfriend such a thing.

c8cwkqo	1	0	You are actually kind of close, all the cellophane wrapped items are contraband in Cuba. But if you bribe the customs agent you can bring them in. In the Miami airport they have rolls, and rolls of the green cellophane. There are stacks of Barbie dolls, shoes, DVD's, and the like. Oh and my bag was at the bottom, and they just keep throwing everything into the middle, it is horrible. 
c8cwq55	1	0	Hahah, no wonder!  I have a similar story from when I was younger trying to enter Mexico with my mother on vacation.  We hadn't renewed my passport, so we were going to use my birth certificate instead (perfectly legal at my age then).  They wouldn't take a copy of the certificate, and we had already landed so my mother just slides the customs agent a wad of cash.  It was a lovely stay in Mexico.

c8cht5z	9	1	Seriously. I spent the first three months I was here sick with some kind of allergic reaction. Turns out that you can have zero allergies in the states, and then move to a different country and become allergic to everything that is outside of your home.
c8chui7	8	1	Hell, the reason kids are sicker today than a generation or two ago is because we sterilize everything. Kids' immune systems are virtually indestructible.  Exposure to germs = immunity forever from that germ.  We shield our kids from everything when their immune system is prime for learning.
c8chwcy	6	1	Yes I agree with this. The only thing that bothers me is the whole "chicken pox parties". I think that is some bullshit.
c8chfgt	8	0	I only ever have that happen at Chick-Fil-A.  I wish more places did this.
c8chh1e	7	1	I was a server at a Cracker Barrel and I did it to tell the difference between diet coke and coke sometimes. And I was always careful never to touch the plastic even though no one could see me. I have thrown them away before if I slipped and accidently touched any part of the plastic.
c8chkij	6	1	nifty trick.  I always assume if someone went through the trouble to put a straw in that way they took extra care not to touch it.  Thanks for letting me keep believing!   
c8chn2f	6	0	Lol in every restaurant I've ever worked, from a huge chain like Cracker Barrel to a tiny mom and pop pizza shop in a strip mall, all the employees have always been very cautious about health standards. They can cost you your job in a split second. But for me (and most people I believe) it's more of an "I wouldn't want something dirty around or in my food so I'm not going to do that to others"   I'm also never big on washing my hands (aside from using the bathroom and before I make food) but when I was at work I washed my hands probably every ten minutes lol
c8chqoe	6	1	So they take the wrapper off before they stick it in. Barbarians.
c8chpz8	6	1	Most places I've been that aren't fast food leave the paper on the end of the straw, but they do put the straw in the glass.
c8chtjb	5	1	There is no such rule. Source - me, I work at a restaurant, we put straws in people's drinks all the time.
c8chgkv	5	0	The In n Out drive-through gives the drink with a straw in it, but the straw still has some of the paper on the exposed portion. 
c8cgnm7	12	2	I would imagine so, you aren't even supposed scoop ice with cups since the outside will touch it.
c8ch74s	31	4	You're not supposed to scoop ice with cups/glasses because a chunk of ceramic/glass can break off and rip open someone's intestines or throat.
c8chcx8	18	1	All fancy with your glass cups. 
c8chf2v	13	3	Yeah, now he's probably going to say we should wash our hands before we handle food. I've had it up to here with your "rules"!
c8cheet	5	1	I've worked in 3 restaurants in my life and this happened in all of them, against policy
c8ci2op	5	0	Maybe he was flirting with the girl and this was her response?
c8chkd0	3	0	I work at Ben &amp; Jerry's and we put straws in the milkshakes, but we leave the end of the paper wrapper on. 
c8ci4gr	3	0	Line cook of over ten years here. Worked many different restaurants. No place I even know of puts the straw in the drink. A lot of cities it's against the board of health for an employee to touch an unwrapped straw and give it to a customer. Servers are taught to give clean dry straws to customers and to lay them in a clean spot on the table, preferably on top of a clean napkin.  The server may have wrote DP for Dr. pepper. But the straw thing was for sure OP. 
c8cijxp	3	0	I get drinks with straws in them at restaurants often. But they always have a piece of the wrapper at the top. Typically open cups (no lid).  I still don't think the employee did this. But they are allowed to put straws in the cups.
c8chojt	2	0	Yes, this is why they come in those little paper sleeves. 
c8chcyj	7	1	Well, not him personally, but a guy he knows.

c8cgpje	10	6	Several restaurants that I go to put two straws in the Doctor Pepper to distinguish it quickly from other soft drinks they bring out.  
c8chgry	7	2	several? Most fast food chains have a button on the lid and any server worth their salt fills drinks to slightly different levels to tell the difference.

c8chpnx	1	0	I worked at a fancy Italian restaurant and we also put straws in the drinks ourselves. which to me, seemed a bit nasty even though we didn't sit around licking the straws. but the thing is, the straws came in a box so at some point you were forced to touch a part of the straw you shouldn't have. I mean just picture it, you're trying to grab a handful of straws out of a tightly packed box of naked straws. shits gonna happen....

c8cje9u	1	1	Somebody has probably already said this, but I'm on my phone so I can't just ctrl+f it... There is no period after "Dr" in Dr Pepper. 
c8cjgo0	1	1	I love absinthe and Doritos
c8cjl8g	1	1	She wants the D...P?
c8cjn75	1	1	I'm not gonna bother rifling through the comments but for the record she probably did this to differentiate it from other dark sodas she was making for other people. It's hard for a server to tell what's a doctor pepper and what's a coke after it's made. Solution? Doctor pepper is the one with 2 straws.
c8cjo75	1	1	she wants the D.

c8cmgbe	5	0	Outside the US the terms spelt and spelled are [interchangeable](http://grammarist.com/spelling/spelled-spelt/) and refer to the past tense or past participle of to spell. Obviously, in the US spelt is a type of wheat, but as I'm British spelt is perfectly acceptable in the way I used it.

c8cobe0	1	1	I'm Australian and my iPad changes it automatically to 'colored'. Sometimes I get stubborn and change it back...

c8czna8	2	1	Ooops. That's the danger of posting pics I find from Facebook, because most of what I find on Facebook is recycled from Reddit. My bad.
c8czw1v	1	1	I don't believe you. When you try to submit a repost reddit gives you a notification that that link had been posted before.

c8calyc	95	16	Front window wont go down?  I got this.
c8cgpmz	25	8	And based on the fact that it's an older model Jeep Cherokee the A/C is probably broken so windows are a necessity.
c8cjzx7	7	1	The seat is probably permanently stuck like that too.
c8chlmj	5	1	During high school, my first car was an '89 Jeep Cherokee. By the time it was passed on to me it was already a decade old and I couldn't leave on the A/C for more than 5 minutes or else the whole thing would over heat. Summers were extremely brutal.
c8chvoy	10	4	Radiator flush or ac condenser replacement! 
c8ciarp	5	1	Had my condenser replaced twice on my 2001 Jeep Cherokee and both lasted just about a year's time :\
c8cierc	4	1	Damn something's wrong there then. I have plenty of friends with XJs and TJs and most have no issues. Of course they have their quirks but the trucks are now at least 12 and older now. 
c8ciwav	4	0	Wranglers=bulletproof... Cherokees= almost bulletproof...grand Cherokees=garbage
c8cjrwh	2	2	Depends on the Grand Cherokee. The first model was just an XJ with a different body, they're considered pretty reliable.  
c8cl1hy	1	0	Except XJ's had a frontcoil/rear leaf suspension where ZJ's had coils on all four corners.
c8cpmpm	1	0	Very true sir

c8chy7q	11	3	WHERE'S WALLACE STRING?!
c8cmo2c	1	0	Stringer is probably my favourite character. So professional despite his criminality.
c8cfv0z	18	1	I actually have nightmares about this. Ill be driving along when all of a sudden I cant reach the wheel cause Im in the back seat. I try and try but I just keep going back in the car. So I lunge forward to grab the wheel with all my might, my finger tips touch it, but its too late. I hit another car head on. And I wake up 
c8cgphb	10	0	I'm shocked to find out that I'm not the only person who's had that particular bad dream.
c8cgq6a	3	0	Im sure its common. Its just freaks me the fuck out 
c8chdrv	4	0	I thought it was common as well, until I mentioned a couple of times in conversations and everybody was looking at like I was alien :-)  We should start a club!  For me usually the problem is that I cannot reach the break.
c8cm52j	2	0	I order the club sandwich all the time, but I'm not even a member, man. I don't know how I get away with it. How'd it start anyway? I like my sandwiches with three pieces of bread. So do I! Well let's form a club then. Alright, but we need more stipulations. Yes we do; instead of cutting the sandwich once, let's cut it again. Yes, four triangles, and we will position them into a circle. In the middle we will dump chips. Or potato salad. Okay. I got a question for ya, how do you feel about frilly toothpicks? I'm for 'em! Well this club is formed; spread the word on menus nationwide. I like my sandwiches with alfalfa sprouts. Well then you're not in the fuckin' club!
c8chw5a	5	0	That sounds like the dreams I've had about fights. I'll go to swing with all my might, like I'm really about to clobber this guy, seriously, somebody better call his mother, and then... it's like I'm underwater. My swing loses all its power and by the time I connect I just barely touch his face. Funny thing is, whoever I'm fighting never has that problem and I usually end up either having a dream about getting my ass kicked or being laughed at for being such a wimp.
c8cjzen	3	1	I have that same dream, it makes you feel like shit. You put so much power into that punch, it's like your about to He-Man that douchebag's face into another dimension with your fist, and then right before impact it's all gone, you basically just throw a wet noodle at the guy.  edit: Don't worry man, someday we will overcome this subconscious dilemma of ours and be able to blast that guy into fucking orbit in front of everyone.
c8cm4os	1	0	I have this happen to me in dreams too but there is also the polar opposite dream that I've had. I am destroying someone with brutal punches over and over, yet they take no damage like they are invincible.
c8cj0k3	3	0	I used to have that same dream bud. Fuck that guy. I'm sure you'd piss on his face in real life. Keep truckin brother.
c8ck2rs	3	0	I... have the bastard nightmare child of those two dreams. I'm trying to drive, but it's like someone has replaced the engine with a set of bike pedals and the wheels with lead disks. It's an emergency and I'm trying to get somewhere in a hurry but it's taking every ounce of my strength to so much as get the car up to walking speed, and everyone behind me is getting pissed off.  Fuck that shit.
c8cnmzj	1	1	Damn, pretty sure I have had a similar dream, just had not recalled it.  I have a recurring scenario where I am driving something bike, car or truck and it gets stuck and I realize it's now tiny so I just pick it up and climb back in.

c8cckw6	12	4	Basketball player.
c8chj6q	5	10	Racist, but most likely correct.
c8clk9w	2	0	Because he has long legs, not because he is black. It's actually probably more racist for you to assume he meant because he was black.

c8chcmw	10	6	Also [world's biggest traffic light?](http://imgur.com/j34wMGy) "Green , Yellow, Yellower, Yellowest, Red"
c8cj7ao	2	0	I think it's (from top to bottom): Red, Yellow, Green, Yellow arrow, Green arrow. Unclear if it's left or right arrow. If it's a left turn there is no red arrow because it's a yield on green and the arrow is just for if there is a lot of people waiting. Right arrow would be the same thing, I think. The arrow would turn green if the left turn arrow for the people to the right is green... wow that's hard to explain.  Edit: removed redundancy.
c8ckpv6	2	0	In pa, sometimes there's a blue light for trains. 
c8cr4jx	1	0	additionally, at least here in houston, left turn signals actually have two red arrows. nothing even seemed off about it to me.

c8chllh	2	0	I have a Jeep, the same thing has happened on his as on mine, the welds bonding the front seat to the floor brace have probably busted, so that the seat tilts ridiculously far back.  I wonder if I'll ever be able to recover once I get a seat that doesn't work that way.  If your seat is reclined that far you'll slip into talking to your shrink while driving.

c8cp2jv	1	0	That's how I would drive on the Jersey Turnpike when I wanted to smoke a joint in the car..  Wind pulls the smoke out, but since it's further back then being RIGHT next to you you don't get as much wind tunneling or bugs in the face.

c8cwefb	2	0	Oh God. This reminds me of an awkward trip I witnessed earlier this week at my daughters preschool. A woman walking near me stepped from a sidewalk to the grass and lost her footing somehow ending up completely on her back in the grass with the contents of her purse strewn about. I ran over, asked if she was ok and started to gather her items. She stuck her leg up in the air and said "Oh, I'm fine. Just doing some stretching, enjoying the sun." This woman was probably in her late 50's, wearing a pant suit and heels, just lying on the wet grass trying to convince me she was just...stretching. After several attempts to help I ended up going to my car and calling the school office. I waited (because I'm nosy) and after a few more leg and arm stretches and some convincing from the principal she stood up, smiled and walked off.

c8cb2fs	357	47	That piano will never sound the same again
c8cbexh	370	52	Truthfully, a piano should never be on an outside wall, the fluctuations in temperature make it fall out of tune much faster.  Poor piano.
c8ccbxx	103	37	Modern Insulation tends to do away with that for the most part, but even the initial placement of the piano that close to the door, exposed to ANY elements, shows that either they have NO room, or they didn't care too much about keeping it safe.

c8cdkdd	13	1	True. Some pianos are just for decoration, especially old-ish ones that aren't worth retuning.
c8cfrkc	10	3	All pianos are worth retuning :(   I love my old secondhand upright yamaha back home far more than the concert grand steinways we use for recordings, it's got more character to it. The songs I've written on it just don't sound the same anywhere else.

c8cdzpn	65	0	Protip: Leave the door open and turn off the heat. Leave water running slightly (hot and cold) in all taps to prevent the pipes from freezing.  Then quickly use a shop vac to get that out before it melt. That will be a lot less damage, especially for the piano.

c8ceb31	13	3	Nope, just the hardware.
c8cen5v	20	1	That's good to know for the next time I install door hardware but forget the door
c8ceuwo	14	0	It's a common misconception that you need the door to keep things out, when really you just need a good set of hinges, a knob, and a lock or two.
c8cdzbd	19	1	Protip: if you only lock your deadbolt, you'll never lock yourself out of your house.
c8ce2h2	4	0	How so?
c8ce9ey	8	0	If you're outside and you lock the deadbolt, that means you have your keys. If you never lock the knob, and only lock the deadbolt, you can't lock yourself out.
c8ccwnb	43	7	So people could just push open your door too if they were strong enough?
c8cd1ox	151	21	Technically, people could just push open the doors to bank vaults, if they were strong enough.
c8ce03q	38	6	You are technically right, and that is the best type of right 
c8ce5ti	3	1	Yes. This is very true.   Also... Is that so you remember your cakeday?

c8cd99e	27	3	Goddamn, wouldn't you have noticed the draft and sealed the damn thing? Weatherstripping is cheap.
c8ce4q4	9	1	Seriously. I'm in Los Angeles and I still put in weather stripping. Rolls of self-adhesive weather stripping are dirt cheap, and can be placed in less than a minute.  You'd also be surprised at how useful it is to have extra weather stripping lying around. This X keeps bumping into that Y.

c8cdwwa	5	0	I live in wi and have never ever seen anything close to what they are getting
c8cdr2c	9	1	I live in south central CT and we got 35" of snow at my house. I went to college in upstate NY by Syracuse, which I think sees the most annual snow of any big city in the country, and only once did I see a single snowfall close to that amount. Also, this snow is so wet and nasty, in my area most regular sized trucks are not able to plow right now because there is so much snow and it is so heavy. 
c8cdtfa	5	0	Yeap. New England doesn't usually get that much snow, and when it does it's soaking wet, which turns to ice at night. Melts in Connecticut, accumulates in Maine.
c8cdw7v	4	0	It's not necessarily the amount of snow that came, rather, the amount of snow that came in this short of time.  I've seen more snow over the accumulation of days and weeks, but that was easily handled due to being slow, so the plows could keep everything clean.  But with 70-90 mph gusts which kept plows off the street during the storm, and 3 ft of snow in under 24 hours, it hurt a bit.
c8cdx2m	9	2	no you don't dude. there is nowhere in america that regularly receives two and a half feet of snow in 24 hours. 
c8cehav	2	1	Eh. This kind of circlejerk has been like a plague on reddit today. If you so much as mention the snowstorm on the east coast, people from any town/country that snows even slightly regularly trip over themselves trying to act like "Yah, we just have that, like all the time. Every day its more feet of snow here."

c8cz9os	1	0	I too was mystified at first, but toward the end they give you a look from his left side.  It gave it away.  I do like the illusion though.  The quality isn't great, but is this the drive through guy?  Anyhow, for anyone who may be confused:  sit down with a box on your lap.  Now walk without dropping it from your lap.  HOLD the box and jump an inch.  Now cut a pair of pants with a velcro-sealed seam in the back.  Then wear a long white T-shirt with a stiffened band to fake a torso.  Put box in pants.  Repeat as you slide out of a truck in front of soon-to-be-traumatized children.  Btw, love this trick.  Simple illusions will always be the best, even if they can be solved.  Extravagance is way too overdone.  Angel, go back to simple man, K.I.S.S.

c8ccqbj	37	6	Did this about two weeks ago to my camry
c8cd2ej	20	3	I'm missing both front handles on my 93 Camry since the winter after I got it. Them things are fragile as fuck. 
c8cd6vl	11	2	I had a 94 where this happened a few times.  The plastic gets brittle as it gets old.  Buy the part from Toyota.  The aftermarket ones are cheap and you'll end up redoing it over and over.  Its easy to replace it yourself
c8cge8j	25	2	Or just remove your doors for free. Never worry about handles again. 
c8cjx70	4	0	Both front handles broke off on my 96 Camry. I replaced the driver's side handle and in the process messed up some electronic something somewhere and now my drivers side window randomly shorts and I am unable to roll it up or down. This usually only happens when it suddenly starts to rain.
c8cq3t2	1	0	Take it apart again and make sure all the connections are good.  Ifthey are you might need the window switch
c8cjvm7	2	0	How easy? Like, even if you are not handy with tools at all?
c8cohqt	3	0	basically you have to take the inside door panel off undo a couple screws from the inside and pull the handle off of these funky rods. reverse and repeat. ive done it in as little as 10 minutes from start to finish. 
c8cq58h	1	0	Yea door are pretty simple.  You might end up breaking some plastic tabs but those are cheap at the dealer
c8cfn1b	6	0	MINE TOO.  I never knew this was a thing. Shit...
c8cpv4c	1	0	I did that to my Camry awhile back.  I then took some old wire and looped it through the remaining handle part to make a new one.

c8ciext	1	0	This happened to my Dad's camry a couple days ago.
c8cis8a	1	0	I came here knowing it'd be on a Camry. My boyfriend's had two handles that were broken off, one on the outside and one on the inside; although the inside one was broken when his beast of a father accidentally pulled it too hard.
c8cjls6	1	0	HOLY SHIT. I did the EXACT same thing to my Camry!!!
c8ckxgi	1	0	The only reason I clicked the comments here is because this happened to my 2001 Camry and I was hoping to see if anyone had an easy fix...
c8cd1fo	35	0	I keep seeing this. Protip: If your door is frozen shut push it while its closed. It will break up the ice that's around the rubber door seal so it wont stick. 
c8cei8v	20	5	Or get fingers between the doors and pull the doors not the fucking handle.
c8cgz0q	25	0	procure a crowbar, smash the window, climb in. Problem solved
c8ch2q3	8	1	The butt end of my knife has a glass breaker, no need.
c8ced8x	2	0	This exactly. I went to a car wash the day of a flashfreeze, the water around my doors/in my locks froze. I just rapped on the frame around the door and it opened relatively easily. No broken handle or anything.
c8cim3c	3	0	Freestyle, or did you go with something you know?  Dangerous Minds is my go to when trying to open my car door.  Only because I memorized it as a kid and is always the first to come to mind...
c8ckrhb	1	0	Freestyle, I had no idea there was an actual method to this.
c8cfpid	1	0	It's not always the door seal. My wife had a car where the passenger handle broke internally on a cold day. Once that happened and she leaned over and popped it quite easily from the inside. It was the mechanism freezing in combination with the plastic getting brittle in the cold. Super cheap door handles.  Few years later before she sold that car the mechanism of the trunk latch kept seizing up even in warm weather.
c8cgqxv	1	0	I find using de-icer in a spray bottle works well. Just spritz, give it a minute, then try.
c8ci6ol	1	0	This works wonders. If I try to open my door and it doesn't come with minor pressure, just lean against the door and maybe push with your hands on the top o the door frame above the window. You hear a little crunch sound and the door will open right up. 
c8cakrc	10	0	Ugh, this just happened to me last week. 500 for a repair with 2 hour maintenance time. 
c8cbbtq	30	2	You got ripped off. You could buy one in a junkyard for like $25 and do this yourself.

c8ccs7s	7	1	what car? Aston Martin????
c8cgfc2	6	0	Tesla S. Have you seen those door handles?!?
c8ci8o3	3	0	I did this to my car once because I didn't realize the door was locked, just thought it was frozen. Spent 60 on a new handle, traded an hour of computer work with a local body shop to get it painted right and took about an hour to pull the door apart and swap the handle. So in the end it cost 60 and 2 hours. 
c8cls8f	1	0	Nice job getting paid $220 an hour, apparently.
c8cfefe	9	1	I feel like at this point Redditors are just ripping handles off their car simply for that sweet sweet karma...

c8cfdel	5	1	Y'all motherfuckers need to stop buying the display models.
c8cdzha	4	1	I feel your pain. This happened to all handles on my 99 sebring. I had resorted to opening the passenger side with a rope rigged to the inside handle, climb over the console to open the driver side...for two years. I have since regained my dignity with a new ride. 
c8ce64e	3	0	This actually happened on my '99 Sebring as well...perhaps a design flaw? Luckily it is only on the passenger side. Any idea of how to fix them?
c8cigkw	1	0	Get one from the junkyard and replace it yourself. There isn't much you can do to prevent it other than being gentle! 
c8cavci	1	0	Sledgehammer. Seriously.
c8cd6l2	2	0	Yup. Happened on my '01 Camry, as well. Now the handle inside is hanging on by a thread.
c8ce0n3	2	0	I did this to a Mazda MPV that was not mine. Wandering around drunk with a friend of mine, noticed some poor sap left his dome light on, and decided to turn it off for them. Grabbed the door handle and ripped it right off.
c8cfedo	2	0	Sorry but i found this hilarious
c8cff84	1	1	When the lock is frozen, this will happen. Get a gallon of lukewarm water, pour on the metal above and it will open in a minute. 
c8cfi3h	1	0	Haha, the same thing happened to me. Then when I needed unrelated work done on it, I had to tell them to get in from the passenger's side. It was pretty funny.

c8cglp0	2	0	My 2005 Nissan Altima had this exact same thing happen to 3 of the 4 car door handles.  EDIT: I live in Florida, so it had nothing to do with the door being frozen shut.
c8chlup	3	0	Yep - happened to me. Cheap plastic, poor design. 
c8cgnng	1	0	My car has one door handle that works from the outside, 2 days ago I broke that one off when I went to open it.   
c8cgoc9	1	1	Hold on, i'm gonna take a pick-axe to my car for some sweet /r/KarmaConspiracy karma. is every single car breaking at once now? this is ridiculous. 
c8cgyjh	2	0	It's the weather man. I'm guessing you don't live in a pretty cold area.   When you walk out to your car and it's completely covered in an invisible shield of ice and then you have the chore of chiseling it free with your keys just so you can get in and go to work, then you can talk.

c8chx06	2	0	www.car-part.com  Order the part and install it yourself.  probably cost you about 25 bucks, and save yourself a few hundred doing it yourself.  Its very easy.  take the interior door card off, and it should become fairly obvious how it comes apart/goes together.  good luck.

c8ckfb6	1	0	Yup, just ripped my driver side door of my tiburan GT off a week ago after some freezing rain. Car was 10 years old though, so I let my girlfriend talk me into just getting a new car. 
c8cklx6	1	1	Volvo made nice sturdy handles that worked in the cold. Never had any issues down to 0* weather.  Good trick is to walk out to your car with a pot of almost boiling hot water and pouring it over your door handles and windows. Wipe windows dry and go on your merry way. Also, warm up the car before going anywhere. Engine oil is mostly gummy at such low temps, and makes for some bad wear when the engine is made to move the car around when cold.
c8clipt	1	1	Oh yeah... Great advice, pour searing hot water all over the frozen glass...... Not like it's going to crack or anything.

c8cc78w	375	57	Seriously, preparing all the ingredients in advance is absolutely worth the effort.  It completely removes any stress from cooking, and allows you to do dishes during any down time.
c8cca1f	238	35	Actually, doing dishes during ANY downtime (I don't have, never had, a dishwasher) will leave you with a nice meal AND a clean kitchen. The kitchen is probably the only place where multitasking actually works.
c8cchl8	147	23	How does one attain this... downtime?
c8cckac	368	54	Vasectomy.

c8ccym7	24	5	Cut/chop/slice/mix everything you need to cook with before you start, if you're prepping as you go along you're gonna have a bad time.
c8ceice	8	0	I read "cut/chop/slice" and for a second there I thought you we still talking about botched vasectomies O_o
c8ccmis	37	9	Are you being serious? If so, only the most complicated of multicourse meals needs constant attention. At some point, something will be heating up or cooking through without you doing anything to it. That's when dishes get done.  The alternative (going back to the computer and browsing Reddit while you wait) just results in overcooked food, anyway.
c8ccpvj	13	1	I'm with you, I scurry back to reddit or something and let my dishes pile up so I can hate myself later. =(
c8ccwxr	25	0	I don't even need the dishes for that...
c8ccwrd	5	0	There's a lot more of it than you imagine, the thing is that you (and I) will usually be standing there staring at whatever is supposed to be done in 30 sec/1 min/5 min/whenever it starts boiling/etc. Once there's more feel for it, you can turn around and wash a few dishes instead. It can even become a tool of sorts, because some stuff is really hard to just ignore even though you know full well you shouldn't be poking at it.
c8cfsk8	4	0	It's annoying when you can make a meal minimizing dish use and one night your wife decides to make it and uses 4 times as many dishes. The next day you're cleaning them all with a silent anger "oh you had to use the strainer did you! You can't use the pot lid? HUH?"
c8cddvj	29	2	AKA "mise en place" or "everything in its place." It's the most basic, important concept in cooking. In a professional restaurant kitchen, prepping food during service is one of the worst versions of being "in the weeds." 
c8ccwic	14	2	If you ever make a stir fry it's essential, and I get to have adorable little bowls everywhere! You take ages to start cooking, but then you're done in like 10 minutes. 
c8cdgls	8	1	Mise en place^(Mise en place)^^^(Miseenplace)  I still don't get formatting...
c8cdtw5	21	3	This is known as mise en place, and it makes cooking any dish infinitely easier.  It's important to read a recipe completely before cooking, and to have everything ready at hand.  You don't have to have separate bowls for each ingredient, though; they do this on cooking shows to demonstrate the quantities of each ingredient.  Items of similar texture (dry, wet, chopped, etc.) that are added to the dish at the same time are put in the same bowl.  If they go into a dish at different times, then they get different bowls.  This not only helps make preparing the dish easier, it ensures you don't leave out an ingredient.  I clean as I go.  If I have 30 seconds or so before the next ingredient is added, I clean the dish.    This is especially important when making a stir-fry.  If you try to prep as you go when stir-frying, you will burn your food.  Once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal.
c8cdcy6	49	8	This meal is easy to make and only takes 20 minutes and uses 6 different pans, 3 different hard to clean utensils and servers 2 people. :)
c8ch4x9	8	0	And you always need a blender and/or food processor, or a very specific shaped baking pan,which you don't find out about until you are halfway through following the recipe. Put that at the beginning where they list the ingredients!
c8cfoan	8	3	Now add 3 room temperature eggs.... But the eggs are in the fridge!
c8chkba	14	1	That's fine, I have a special high-end fridge that keeps everything inside at room temperature.
c8cbsc2	226	26	I always keep mine next to my powdered baby seal marrow.
c8ccmi9	74	4	Fun fact: you can use dogs or pigs to root around the ice and draw out the baby seals the same way you one does for truffles.  
c8ce2ur	14	1	I just learned about truffles for the first time in Bio today. Fungi have *very* strange life cycles.
c8cehv2	8	0	I learned about them from the Simpsons. Education is failing me.
c8cebsi	5	0	So do algae. Some species of red algae have a life cycle stage called a carpospore (unfortunately the wikipedia page sucks), which is basically a little nodule of spores that are parasitic on the mother plant. 
c8cg3pw	3	0	It's Saturday?
c8cgd58	4	0	Ok, reading my bio book.
c8ceso1	16	0	And the 5 ounce container of saffron, the bag of civet cat coffee beans, the gold leaf, ground rhinoceros horn and hummingbird tongues.
c8cdamf	10	3	Baby seal marrow with unicorn oils and fairy dust make for a great desert!
c8cbwo5	182	22	Ina always talks about "good" ingredients ("good vanilla extract"). I then find myself having an existential crisis over the definition of "good" and whether or not my ingredients are good enough.
c8ccya8	63	3	Dammit - I used the evil vanilla extract, and now my cake tastes like Satan.
c8ccc1i	81	13	If it tastes good to you, it's good. If it tastes like ass, it isn't good
c8ccm62	62	9	Unless it's marmite, then tasting like ass is intentional...
c8ccpff	32	7	You shut your filthy mouth. 
c8ccnny	12	3	Marmite isn't usually served on its own. It's often used as a base for [consomme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consomm%C3%A9) which clears all the ass out of it.   Edit: If you aren't aware, marmite tastes weird because you burn the shit out of everything you use to make it, like till it starts to charcoal. This makes it super dark in color, but also makes it bitter. This is why it's great for consomme.  Edit: holy shit was not aware people were talking about yeast extract. WAY DIFFERENT, do not use yeast extract to make consomme lol
c8ccx8i	7	0	I don't trust my palate enough to make this distinction. 
c8cd1a4	9	3	If you can't tell what tastes good and what doesn't, does it matter if it tastes bad?
c8cdlfl	13	0	If you serve the food to other people, then yes it does matter.
c8ccvvm	24	1	Technically, most of the spices in my cabinet are "expired", but I just go by if they seem to smell like what they're supposed to smell like.  Who the hell can afford to replace spices every two years?  You'd have to cook a fuckton to use a whole thing.
c8cdaal	13	0	I think ive been using the same spices since i moved out of my parents house. And i think some of them used to be moms. 
c8cdgjm	14	1	I found out my dad had a HUGE thing for Indian food in law school.  I was looking through our spice cabinet, and McCormick has a thing on their website where you can find the age of your spices.  I noticed a ton of Indian spices from 1985.  I asked him about it.  He told me "Never again".
c8cea1v	5	1	[For the lazy](http://www.mccormick.com/Spices101/HowOldSpices.aspx)
c8cebiv	9	0	It's like a time capsule.      Or a thyme capsule.  I already have my jacket on.  See ya.
c8ccuit	19	1	Ina gets all of her ingredients from farm stands and dairies where she knows everyone by name. Of course the food is going to taste good for her.
c8cd360	11	0	Best Vanilla Extract.........make your own. Vodka, plus vanilla beans ( you can find good ones in bulk on ebay) and a mason jar, aged for 3 months or longer. AMAZING! 
c8cett9	18	2	But what are good vanilla beans?!  OH THE HUMANITY   &lt;/s&gt;
c8ccy3f	5	0	I'm sure she probably buys expensive stuff, but a few fresh beans from Beanilla and a handle of cheap vodka will make good vanilla extract very easily.
c8cbeoo	304	28	"Here I'm using about 4 oz. of red elderberries, but if you don't have that, strawberries work here as well."   WELL OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO USE STRAWBERRIES
c8cdews	52	5	now how many strawberries are 4oz.

c8cdl6b	7	1	half a cup.
c8chljs	5	0	You can buy red elderberries at practically any roadside stand in a town that's a thousand miles from where you actually live.

c8cbowz	122	18	"If you are unable to find the tear-drops of a unicorn...tap water will work just fine"
c8cdhz9	19	0	IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
c8chgew	3	0	[](/raritywhine)  What meal could possibly be worth making a unicorn cry?
c8ccqal	104	16	What I hear:  "If you can't afford black truffles and saffron I suggest subbing them with handfuls of broken glass and rat poison, you poor fuck."
c8cbqjy	267	28	It really depends on the show. Paula Deen is uber cheap and probably prefers store bought, while Ina Garten (picture) is notoriously sophisticated-- probably because she lives in the Hamptons and has a lot of friends that are as fruity as a pastry. Mmmmm....... pastry.....
c8cck69	196	17	And then there is "Aunt Sandy" (Sandra Lee) who uses mostly processed boxed mixes...also, she is drunk. 
c8cd4d0	90	8	Vodka themed tablescapes.
c8cdfv6	78	3	&gt;"It's cocktail time!"  Jesus Christ, Sandra, you talk about growing up starving as a child but apparently there was always booze around!
c8cdbcq	30	0	It's vodka time for aunt sandy!  
c8cdj41	20	0	Her tablescapes and daily cocktail are a constant source of amusement. 
c8ceou9	18	3	My favorite Sandra Lee recipe:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we2iWTJqo98
c8cgtq3	4	1	Okay now imagine if she used Nutella instead of the cocoa frosting. 
c8cdlq0	11	1	We call her "stepmom".
c8cdhs8	8	1	I used to watcher her show, but not because of her cooking. If you know what I mean. 
c8cdkg4	23	3	Yeah, she has great tits.
c8cdott	37	4	None can compare to Giada DeLaurentis though  Bonus: http://imgur.com/mm4DkR5 
c8cet7a	15	2	Nigella has lovely assets.

c8cdqzf	8	0	Nope, Giada is phenomenal. 
c8cf47o	8	1	I can't get past the fact that her mouth is too big for her head, which is in turn twice as big as it should be for her body
c8cdoko	12	3	Sandra Lee defeats the whole purpose of cooking for yourself.  If I wanted processed, expensive foods I'd go out to eat.
c8cd8k0	3	0	She's my favorite.
c8cc5mi	47	5	Ina uses an obscene amount of salt though sometimes
c8cc8ap	26	4	To me she uses WAY too much pepper.  Recreating her recipes I have to use a half, sometimes a quarter of the black pepper she uses.
c8ccb69	58	8	Some people use pepper as a seasoning, other people use pepper as a spice.
c8cckdt	64	9	I like my pepper with a bit of food in it. 
c8ccmc2	26	5	then you should try [steak au poivre](http://chefmaven.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/2206645305_6323b63201.jpg)
c8ccne7	9	0	Welp....just found a use for the two canisters of whole peppercorn I have in the cabinet.  My grinder's fucked up and I've been too lazy to replace it. 
c8ccoz8	21	3	wrap it in a towel and hit it with a hammer/ heavy pot. You want it at least crushed.  Edit: also, sear the un-pepper side, then mid-heat the pepper side when you flip it. Pepper burns and turns bitter, you want a crust, not char.
c8ccpvk	18	2	The grinder or the peppercorn? 
c8ccv9r	24	4	Yes.
c8ccv1s	5	0	Here's someone who knows a little something.  
c8ccwqu	8	1	(professional chef)
c8ccuj1	12	1	Today we are making a salt and salt cake topped with salt, salt-covered salt, salt, and salt.
c8ccamt	5	0	And cream, though, who can blame her.
c8cco4b	37	16	"Now to start this dish off you're gonna put in two cups of sugar, two of salt, four sticks of butter, and a healthy drizzle of orrrl." Fuck just thinking about her say "oil" is giving me chest pains.
c8cd25o	67	2	you're thinking of paula deen
c8cevup	14	0	Her "husband."  
c8cgskg	8	0	The guy who comes home on the weekends and likes chicken much to the disdain of Ina 
c8ci8be	3	0	I always got the impression that he really dislikes that she has a cooking show. He always seems really put out whenever she makes a big deal about making his "favorite meal" *du jour*. And then they have to film him eating it. He looks uncomfortable every time.
c8cchl5	39	4	That's why I (sort of) like Rachel Ray even though she does get a lot of hate, she's pretty realistic about things.  
c8cdh3t	53	6	Why *does* she get so much hate? She makes some really good, simple and CHEAP dishes. Love her!  Meanwhile I feel like the scum of the earth watching Ina since she's so FUCKING snooty. She has some good recipes as well but what. the. fuck is GOOD vanilla extract? Or butter? Gawd.
c8cdw8b	51	1	"Use 2 cups of *good* milk."  Yeah, like I was just about to use rancid milk, thanks for saving me from food poisoning.
c8cdy4w	20	1	Make sure your *good* milk, while still *good*, is also from a *good* cow that's possibly been worshiped all it's life and willingly gave up it's *good* milk. Ugh.
c8ce4vb	20	1	Good milk comes from a cow that was brought up right, lived in the right neighbourhoods and went to a good school.  Good chocolate milk came about with desegregation.  
c8cesvl	13	0	"Good" vanilla extract is the kind that isn't made from synthetic vanillin and tastes more complex and vanilla-y. "Good" butter comes from grass-fed cows - it doesn't need food dye to be yellow, and it's more creamy and buttery-tasting.  Believe it or not, basic ingredients do have varying degrees of quality, and it isn't snooty to notice the difference. I find that people who take offense at this either haven't tried the 'good' stuff, or they just really can't tell the difference and think everyone else is making it up. Either way, open your mind a little bit. I can't do the whole wine tasting thing, but I don't go around saying that oenophiles are full of shit. Why knock a cook with a discerning palate?
c8cgvge	3	0	No, you're absolutely correct, I accept that I've most likely never tasted the "good" stuff. I unfortunately don't have the means to indulge but I hope I can one day.  I guess I just attribute my feels to the weirdness of her show being back-to-back with Paula Deen's, Rachel Ray's, and Sandra Lee's shows. They're catering more to my lifestyle and "culinary" skill than Ina Garten's show is.   I use what I can afford and like to hope that it's not utter shit just because I wasn't able to use the "good" stuff.  But one day I'll get there. One day! :)
c8cdusb	26	2	Her voice is really grating.  I can't stand to listen to her.  Vanilla extract?  There's a difference between brands.  [Here is some good vanilla extract.](http://cookinghussy.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/pure-vanilla-extract.jpg)
c8ce2dn	10	1	I don't know that much about the subject, but I understand Rachel Ray isn't a chef, she's an actress. Someone else actually does the hard work  "inventing" the dishes, and she just goes through the motions.
c8ce4sh	5	0	Oh really? Dang. :/ Well, whoever her "writer" is can keep the dishes coming! I'll keep tuning in.
c8cdu8a	8	2	good butter?  it's stuff that's better than bad butter.  Try a couple different varieties until you find one that has a good texture and taste for your cooking.  On the west coast we have a fairly large company called Organic Valley that makes great butter for baking, for general cooking you can sometimes do with a decent store brand variety.
c8cdwl4	6	1	Well, sure, there are butters that are better than grocery store crap but I mean... for some of the things she's making, does it REALLY MATTER? I guess that's all relative because the people I cook for don't give a damn. xD
c8cdhk2	13	2	Except for olive oil. Christ! Extra virgin shouldn't be used like that. I swear she must be getting kick backs from Filippo.
c8cdqm8	25	1	Don't you mean EVOO
c8celsk	7	1	Send me your extra virgins, I'll use them proper.
c8ccjst	37	5	Have you read about Ina and her husband? Jesus Christ, they're in the vein of Kennedy superhuman breeding and illuminati intelligence. They have their mitts in all the pies. 
c8cdrp0	20	1	She has the most Faaaaabulous gay friends though. 
c8cg4gi	3	0	My aspiration as a gay man is to befriend her and reap the benefits of her glorious cooking, but alas, I'm in Ohio.
c8ccsls	98	10	Good Eats is almost always a fantastic exception, and beyond that it's the show that taught me to cook. Alton Brown doesn't often toss recipes at you, but rather explains how it works and why it works, so you actually learn about the craft of cooking rather than just lists of instructions.
c8ce45g	18	3	Which lets you modify recipes to fit your tastes and what you have on hand. I have kept myself and my boyfriend from starving by making something delicious out of unconventional ingredients.
c8cef7d	11	0	Exactly. "You have to know the rules before you can break them." I'm able to improvise now in ways I never would have thought to before.
c8cex7e	6	0	I think my favorite example of that was his episode with cooking steaks in the oven. He said that searing them to "seal in the juices" is actually a bad idea because it makes the steak weigh less overall.  Then he says that it DOES make a nice crust if you're looking for a delicious rare steak by nearly burning the steak on a super hot pan.
c8cdtjb	20	2	Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course is like that too.
c8cftut	17	1	I just can't handle the word "cookery."  It's like "maths," it sounds like you're making words up.  Dangit, British English, so silly.
c8ceayd	9	0	Right.  He tells you where you can cut corners and why.  The use of a microwave in particular is what impresses me.  "You could steam this, which is generally recommend, or just save yourself the trouble and throw it in a bag with a quarter cup of water and microwave the bitch for four minutes."
c8cdw1t	6	0	I found a link to a Youtube playlist the other day [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoodEatsComplete/videos?view=1&amp;flow=grid) with the majority of the episodes up.
c8ci9q1	3	0	The only problem I have with Alton is that I don't have a kitchen scale and he prefers to give ingredients by weight.
c8ccs14	25	0	I live in the Netherlands and I don't know any virgin milk maids. I should totally get to know them, I love cooking!
c8cd21k	10	0	Go for the non-virgin ones, if you know what I'm sayin'...

c8cb46d	43	1	"I find an avocado pitter to work perfectly on these."
c8cbdym	88	9	Cut around the pit lengthwise. Twist and pull apart. Using a large knife, chop into the pit to get the blade stuck and twist, pulling the pit out.  If anyone has an avocado pitter they are just incompetent.

c8cct7m	8	0	that was far more interesting than I expected 
c8ccqaa	16	4	Haha!! he 'diced' it.    I'm sorry, I'm on my 11th hour of my 12 hour shift, as an extremely bored cashier. I guess I'm just a little slap happy but that 'dice' thing was hilarious. 
c8cd2ya	5	0	The reason I feel justified in reading to the bottom of many discussions on here is finding links like this... Thanks for sharing a good one!
c8cdguq	5	0	that was really cool. I think that was the first time I've seen live-action stop-motion like that. Great sound effects, too.

Using a hand masher works the potato more, and develops starch proteins. These cause a starchy, gummy, stickiness to your end result. All restaurants use ricers or [food mills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_mill)  It guarantees a non-lumpy product that's pure potato of the highest quality.

c8cccgk	42	2	ITT: People that know way more about cooking than me to the point that I'm uncomfortable
c8cd6en	18	2	Meh, don't feel bad, I haven't seen anything in this thread you wouldn't know if you were a $10 an hour line cook.

c8cceyh	11	0	&gt;If you can't get butter made from the milk of virgin Dutch maids, cow made is fine
c8cdjfb	6	0	visualizing...  yep.  boner time.
c8ce908	8	1	Embarrass the parsnip prior to annoying it in boiling water.  Embarrassing times may vary....  
c8cbbj4	18	3	POSH NOSH!!!

c8cdb7n	6	0	For best results, raise a cow and a bull from a calf, then raise their calf into a cow, then churn it's milk into butter before shooting it.
c8cdkdq	5	0	i keep some virgin dutch milkmaids in the basement for just such an occasion.
c8cdnlo	5	0	The sad part is when you do have the correct ingredients and follow the recipe to a T, it never looks or even tastes like it's supposed to.  
c8ch2ad	6	1	Ina Garten cooks pretty standard American stuff. Fresh herbs are about as fancy as she gets. And they're not hard to get. 
c8ccv8w	9	2	That caption reminds me of a fetch quest in LoZ: Spirit Tracks. There's a medium who will sell you a vessel "made with clay from the hands of a maiden with the purest heart" to bring to the Lokomo of the Snow Sanctuary. That was the most eccentric item to bring someone ever in a Zelda game.
c8cdv37	10	2	At least when Heston Blumenthal has a 'you can do this a home' recipe that calls for dry ice for fast freezing, he goes to the trouble of finding a hack for you to do it at home (aerosol can, sprayed upside down) if he can.   The fake types of TV cook who have no real idea what they are doing use rare ingredients as a crutch for the poor results. *"Oh you didn't use .... no wonder it doesn't taste right."*  My other peeve is when the recipe calls for "10 grams of ...." of something that they only sell in Kg units, costs a bomb, and is useful nowhere else.
c8ccl9n	154	78	That bitch is the absolute worst at that shit, too. "Now, I only use Gouvenier Bleu Cheese from from the Bonveletpetit Missionary in the Managetio Villiage in the south of France. I know most of you wont be able to even afford a small portion of this cheese, so Kraft should work out just fine." She is a real stuck up cunt.
c8ce8wc	69	10	Honestly, this hostility towards her is a little unneeded.  She lives a charmed life - yes. But half the time, I'm watching the show because it's fun to see how the "other people" live. Obviously when she says "don't you hate it when you have too many heritage-varietal heirloom tomatoes in your garden" she's not expecting everyone to actually have that problem. It's more of a daydream show plus some wonderful, usable recipes.
c8ch210	7	0	I canned 75 quarts of heirloom tomatoes last year... 
c8cjp9p	6	2	I'm happy reading this. I personally only watch her show because it really is *a lot* more different than any other cooking show on the network. Sure, the other chefs have money, but Ina actually shows her lifestyle. She lets everyone know she's well off with each and every episode. At times, I agree that she comes off snooty, but again, it makes her show different from any other. (And well...  A lot of the food she makes looks damn good!)
c8ccwcs	75	9	I guess better than saying "Those of you who can't afford this cheese can just fuck right off and eat shit instead."
c8cd03w	44	14	She does this for multiple ingredients in literally every single one of her shows, it comes off as a little "Hahaha you poor underlings can't even afford this and I fly out to France four times a year just to get it." Which is kind of how you sound when you say if you don't use ridiculously expensive, rare ingredients then you are eating shit.
c8cdtgu	16	1	The Frugal Gourmet, Jeff Smith, apparently had a trip to Italy paid for by the Parmigiano-Reggiano folks. For months afterwards he used it in everything had went on about it fits in with frugal cooking (huh?). He fell off the television screens when it came out that his taste palette extended to young boys.
c8chdoj	6	0	That's a dark twist. 
c8ce2uv	28	10	So rich people shouldn't be allowed to watch cooking shows or something? Just stick to Paula Deen if it bothers you that much.
c8cdl1j	3	1	Wait, there are virgin Dutch milkmaids????
c8cdvk0	6	2	There is no such thing as Dutch **VIRGIN** milk maids.
c8ce77k	6	2	Yeah, they can either be Dutch or they can be virgin, but they cant be both.  
c8ce7f1	4	0	[Reminds me of the rejected Doritos commercial for last year's Superbowl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3usaGfn7r0w)
c8cdgl3	11	5	I watch a lot of Food Network, and I feel like this tactic is intentional, so the people trying to recreate the meal aren't following the recipe exactly.  That way, if it ends up not working out, you can say "well, it's probably because I used the store-bought..."
c8ccu8b	3	0	[Blowtorch!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTl333YSwkY)
c8ce1rl	3	0	I think the dutch-milkmaid-tear-butter shop would object to your use of the term "store bought"
c8cqdpj	1	1	Sorry, but that's really not right. It's a sculpture of Abraham and Isaac. That's just a funny angle. [Here.](http://frejsa10.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/abe-and-isa.jpg)
c8cu8tz	1	0	Well it seems to me that Abraham and Isaac had a very close relationship.
c8codav	7	1	Pretty sure that is a picture of three kids with their dead mom... I learned about people doing that from a TIL a while back.
c8cod2y	5	1	You want to know what's creepier than the Mother covered in a sheet?  That baby is dead.
c8cp2hu	1	0	Either that or it was a way for the children to stay quiet and calm, while the photograph was being taken.
c8cr3jw	1	1	Actually the mom (under the sheets) is dead. A while back they thought that they should take pictures with their dead relatives. 
c8crcfe	3	0	Actually, I think it was custom for the mother to wear a sheet when taking a picture with their dead children. I could be wrong, but that's what I remember from a previous thread.
c8csoe6	1	0	Thanks for letting me see that right before going to sleep! So not r/funny

c8cxsbt	5	1	not sure if NSFW tag is for man pooping or the woman committing what seems to be a murder..
c8cyqe0	1	0	Woman in obvious distress.  Other woman attempting to render aid.  Man pooping.  Should I take a photo?  Yes, yes I will.
